His own personal reading journey

Workshop (35min)
We will break into small discussion groups

First, we will practice reading a couple of aphorisms and philosophical passages together using the techniques discussed.
Next, everyone will share their our own personal reading strategies with the group
Finally, we will all come together to share takeaways

My hope is that by the end of the hour we will all walk away with new strategies to get the most out of our next book.

Canâ€™t wait!
