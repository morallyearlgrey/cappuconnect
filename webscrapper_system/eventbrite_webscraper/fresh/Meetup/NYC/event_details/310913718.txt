Can you imagine what is was like to be on a ship for days coming to a new land? The excitement, the hopes, the dreams! Join us as we journey back over 100 years ago and walk in the same area where over 12 million people passed. Today we venture over to Ellis Island. We meet at the screening facility (near The View restaurant in Battery Park) at 11 AM. Please purchase your ticket for the Statue City Cruises ($25.50 for Adults; $22.50 for Seniors) here for 11 AM on Oct. 4: https://tix.cityexperiences.com/j/hstatueco/9f76cb4672d204e58b677c2ddf99504ae0b4e9b027b64e6b. Please arrive on time as we need to go through security (think airport security). We want to get on the 11:25 AM ferry leaving from Battery Park. Your ticket includes round trip ferry to/from Ellis Island, access to the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration, free tour, free documentary film and free audio guide. We will not be getting off the ferry as a group at Liberty Island (Statue of Liberty). Feel free to bring lunch (no glass please) or we can eat at the cafe on Ellis Island (reasonable prices for New York). We'll leave Ellis Island on the 5:10 PM ferry back to Battery Park or whenever everyone is ready. Those who wish can join us for dinner at an inexpensive restaurant. All are welcome and bring a friend.
