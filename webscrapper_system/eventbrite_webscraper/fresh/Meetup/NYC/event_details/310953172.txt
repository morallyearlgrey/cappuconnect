This is a workshop to teach you how to manage your loneliness. Bring a journal and pen to take notes if you'd like.

Loneliness can sneak in after a breakup, a big life change, or even while surrounded by people. In this workshop, we’ll talk honestly about what loneliness really is — and what it isn’t. You’ll learn how to work *with* the feeling instead of fighting it, uncover the deeper needs it’s pointing to, and leave with tools to start feeling more connected to yourself and others.

Expect thoughtful conversation, supportive exercises, and the chance to feel a little less alone just by showing up.
