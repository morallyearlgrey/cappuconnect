You've mastered beginner-level stuff.

You know your way around a scene.

You've been doing this long enough to spot bad improv from across the room.

But you're stuck...

Either committing to 8-week intensive programs you don't need...

Or settling for drop in classes where no one actually is brave enough to have fun

This isn't that.

This is 3 hours of pure character work with performers who actually GET it.

We're diving deep into the stuff most classes skip over...

Advanced character development through high-stakes scenes.

Working with other artists who've been doing this for years.
And yeah... maybe plotting how we can all do MORE of this without waiting for someone else to give us permission.

We're limiting the number of performers, so everyone gets real stage time.

Not just 30 seconds of "introduce yourself through gibberish."
