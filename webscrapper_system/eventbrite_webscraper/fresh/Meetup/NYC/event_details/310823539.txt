We play from 7:45 - 10:00pm - (2) 45 minute halves and (1) 5-10 minute break at half-time. 11 v 11 game; rotating goalies every 10 minutes.

Intermediate or better skill level. Absolutely no beginner level players

ALL NEW PLAYERS to the group MUST submit payment for the game of $6.00 by venmo at "@ron-bello" - Payment must be made within 4 hours of signing up for the game. I am sick and tired of no-shows. I will refund payments within 12-hours from game-time cancellation. You may also get a meetup message from me as well to confirm for all new players.

On Field time is 7:45pm - My Cell # is (718) 216-7129 for anyone running late. ONLY a text or call will hold your spot in the event you show up past 8:00pm.

Last chance to drop a spot is 4 Hours BEFORE game time. Any drops after more than likely will result in suspension from the group.
Failure to show up to a game will result in permanent suspension from the group.
NO player is allowed to join the waitlist; you will be removed. Do not be sneaky.

All players who sign up depend on each and every other player signed up to SHOW UP. If you no-show or cancel your spot 1-2 hours before the game it is disrespectful to them and to me as the organizer.
