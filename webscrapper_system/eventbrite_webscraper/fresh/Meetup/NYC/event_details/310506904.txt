Beginners welcome! Friendly group! Paid event!

Join naturalist Debbie Becker on a two-hour fall Bird Walk. Admire the changing leaves and ripening berries as nature changes seasons. The walk includes plants and mushrooms but focuses mainly on bird and hawk identification.

The Fall migration is a spectacular event!

Have fun birding and meeting others who love nature.
