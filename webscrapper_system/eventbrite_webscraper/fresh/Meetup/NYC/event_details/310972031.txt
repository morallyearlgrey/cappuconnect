Welcome to NYC Skeptic’s “Skeptical Dinners,” a series of events facilitated by Prof. Massimo Pigliucci, a philosopher and biologist at the City College of New York. The idea is similar to that of the Ancient Greek symposia: let’s get a small number of like-minded people together over drinks and food and discuss interesting subjects!

These days there is a lot of talk about truth, but few people seem to have a notion of what exactly that magic word means. Let’s dig into several philosophical conceptions of truth and see how they may apply to the real world of science, pseudoscience, fake news, and alternative facts.

Since these are dinner events at a restaurant, you are expected to consume some food. Also please treat your rsvp seriously and update it if you decide not to come. If you don’t and we end up with empty seats, you may be barred from some of the next meeting. Thanks for understanding!

Malibu Diner is conveniently located in Chelsea, reachable by the #1 subway (23rd Street stop).
