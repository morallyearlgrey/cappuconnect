In our increasingly digital world, data and algorithms silently shape nearly every aspect of our lives, from the content we consume to critical decisions about health, employment, and governance. But beneath this convenience lies profound philosophical and ethical questions.

Join us for an insightful exploration with Hannah Gehring, Product Manager in Data Analytics, as we examine the rise of Dataism, a belief system that elevates data-driven algorithms above human judgment.

Drawing on influential works such as Homo Deus, Invisible Women, Stolen Focus, and Empire of AI, this presentation will uncover hidden biases, ethical dilemmas, and societal consequences emerging from our reliance on data.

Expect to leave equipped with fresh perspectives on autonomy, equity, corporate responsibility, and the urgent philosophical implications of living in an algorithmically-driven society.
