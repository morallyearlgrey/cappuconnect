Everyone, the Bushwick Open Studios is a really fun yearly event! Artists open their work spaces to the public and show their work. We'll see some cool art, chat with people, maybe pick up some free wine or cookies along the way! Come join us. Ater the art we will catch an early dinner at a nearby venue.
