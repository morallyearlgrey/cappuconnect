It's also a super fun industry where you are likely to be asked to make different death and "being hit" sounds :)
​
In this taster workshop, you will get a glimpse into this industry and get to practice some of the actor's work in it, including reading a script (with death sounds) and getting feedback.

Your teacher: Shaun Mendum
Shaun has worked as an actor, performer, and Voice Actor for years.
His work includes Video Games, animation, audiobooks, audio drama, documentaries, and more…
He has given talks about voice acting at Comic Con London and EGX London.
Shaun is patient, generous, and honest, and will create a safe, supportive, and collaborative environment.
