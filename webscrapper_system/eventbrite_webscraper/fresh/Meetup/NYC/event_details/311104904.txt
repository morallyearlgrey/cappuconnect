DRESS WARMLY ENOUGH FOR POSSIBLY COOL EVENING
This meeting is for everyone who wants to learn how to meditate, especially those who think they can't meditate because they can't stop their mind from thinking--a common misconception. If you're willing to be open and aware, you can meditate, regardless of how much or how little you're thinking.
I will emphasize a simple awareness method, but I'll also describe the other two common techniques, mantra and breath watching, in case you feel more comfortable with those.
We will start with a short 15 minute meditation, then progress to a 20 minute session. In between we will discuss our experiences and any questions that may arise.
COST: Free.
LOCATION: After meeting outside Central Park, we will walk about 5 minutes to a quiet spot at the sailboat pond.
TRANSPORTATION: 6 train to 77th St, then walk west on 77th, then walk 3 blocks west to Fifth Avenue.
MY QUALIFICATIONS: I have been meditating daily for about fifty years. I attended a weekly Sufi silent meditation group for 24 years and a Buddhist one for 3.years, Ã lthough my approach will be primarily secular. And I wrote an article for the Berkley Wellness Letter about myths that discourage people from meditating.
