Yes, we're meeting in person at a midtown location. The Hugh is located on Lexington Avenue between 53 & 54 Streets in Manhattan, The E and 6 trains stop right there at Lexington Ave/53 Street. Check mta.info for weekend changes in service, like rerouting of trains, We'll be in the atrium inside. This place is formerly the Citicorp atrium.

IMPORTANT - most dining venues in the atrium are closed on Sundays. You might want to pack a sandwich and drink to bring with you. No problem here with outside food. There are also nearby places outside to get something.

For this meetup, we will play Boggle and Scrabble. I will have a couple of regular Scrabble sets. You can bring your own Scrabble set if you want.

Attendance is limited. If you have to cancel, change your RSVP so someone on the waiting list can join us.

I'll bring the games, paper, dictionaries and cheat sheets. You bring yourself and a pen or pencil. So RSVP and join us. This place is handicap accessible.

I will also have sweet treats for those who get Scrabble bingos. Okay, you know what to do.
