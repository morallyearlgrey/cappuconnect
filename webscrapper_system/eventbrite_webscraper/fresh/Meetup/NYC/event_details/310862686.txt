Join us for a 5k run (or whatever distance you're comfortable with) around the reservoir. The run is a 5K loop starting at Bethesda Terrace (please note this is one level above Bethesda Fountain), going counterclockwise on East Drive, turning left onto the reservoir around E 85th St level, exiting the Reservoir around W 86th St level, then south on West drive and finally turning left (east) on 72nd St at the Daniel Webster statue to end at Bethesda Terrace. All levels/speeds/distances are welcome - it's just more fun to run with friends!

We'll also head for dinner/drinks after the run. We rotate between an Upper East Side and Upper West Side restaurant week after week. We will announce the watering hole at the run.
