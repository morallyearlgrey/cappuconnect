Join behavioral health coach Colette Ellis for an insightful discussion on maintaining mental wellbeing during the stressful periods of job hunting or founding a startup. As the founder of Libbie Health, Colette will share from experience on challenges faced navigating tech as a Black woman and building an AI app.

Colette will introduce the mindfulness-based techniques built into the Libbie app, like EFT tapping and breathing exercises to short-circuit anxiety and boost resilience. You will learn practical tools for self-care that can be applied on the go. She'll also address how focusing on mental fitness cultivates an innovative mindset and strong workplace culture.
