💬 Why Learners Love This:
“It’s like having English-speaking friends every night.”

"this is such a great place to practice speaking English and the coordinators are really helpful and friendly. In my perspective, I have no place to practice speaking English and share my ideas with other non native speakers. This platform make it happened. Keep up the good work. Thank you."

> "I've made many friends here and had the opportunity to learn about their countries and cultures. It’s a completely different experience compared to real life, where I often find it difficult to approach people and learn about their stories. This environment really helps people feel safe and comfortable, making it easier to engage in open conversations.
