The 34th Street Partnership's free weekly outdoor origami classes are returning to Greeley Square for the summer! All ages and skill levels are welcome, and all materials are provided. No registration is required. Instruction is by Deb Pun.

The classes will take place in Greeley Square Park, by the statue of Horace Greeley near the southern end of the park. Greeley Square Park is located between 6th Avenue and Broadway and between 32nd and 33rd Streets.

Classes are scheduled for 3PM-4PM on Mondays through September 22. If rain is predicted, the class will be rescheduled for a later date in September.
