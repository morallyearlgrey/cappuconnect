About the Walk
We’ll explore outdoor art installations, murals, and several beloved community gardens in Chinatown, the Lower East Side, Little Italy/SoHo, and the East Village—celebrating the vibrant cultural mosaic that defines New York City.

Highlights Along the Route

City Hall Park: Explore Thaddeus Mosley’s “Touching the Earth”—eight monumental bronze sculptures cast from wood carvings, reflecting African diasporic traditions and Mosley’s intuitive sculptural rhythm.
Manhattan Municipal Building: Admire the Guastavino tile arch system—a marvel of structural and aesthetic innovation introduced to the U.S. in 1885.
Police Plaza: Pause at the Sugar House Prison Window, a haunting remnant of a Revolutionary War-era prison with a tragic legacy.
Sara D. Roosevelt Park: Pass by the Hua Mei Bird Garden, a morning gathering spot for Chinese men and songbird enthusiasts. We’ll likely miss the birds, but it’s worth a return visit if you're curious.

Community Garden Highlights

M’Finda Kalunga Garden: Founded in 1982 to reclaim public space and support low-income housing. Today, it’s a vibrant hub for cultural events, gardening, and even chickens. The garden sits atop a historic African burial ground, where free and enslaved Black New Yorkers were buried from the late 1700s until 1853.
Elizabeth Street Garden: A nearly 200-year-old public space recently saved from demolition thanks to community advocacy.
Liz Christy Garden: NYC’s first community garden, established in 1973 by the Green Guerillas. A testament to grassroots urban renewal.
6BC Botanical Garden: A hidden gem in the heart of the East Village, 6BC is beloved by locals and visitors alike—especially for its whimsical tree house with a tiny library tucked inside. It’s a bucket-list stop for anyone who loves secret gardens and community spirit.

We'll enjoy our lunch break in one of these gardens—Elizabeth Street Garden if space allows, or M’Finda Kalunga or Liz Christy as alternatives.
