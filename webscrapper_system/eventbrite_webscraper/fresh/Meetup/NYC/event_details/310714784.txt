Happy 11 years of book club, ladies! This month we're going to be reading "We Might Just Make It After All: My Best Friendship With Kate Spade" by Elyce Arons. Here's the link and description: https://amzn.to/41mRFfj

When Elyce Arons first met Katy Brosnahan in a University of Kansas dorm room, she had no idea that this polo shirt–wearing Missouri girl would not only become her best friend but also change the course of her life. Back then, Katy and Elyce were preoccupied with frat parties and The Mary Tyler Moore Show; within a decade, they’d be scraping by in New York City, working day jobs to spend nights building a new line of handbags that would one day revolutionize the accessories industry.

We Might Just Make It After All brings us on the rollercoaster of adventures (and misadventures) that the best friends embarked on, from transferring colleges on a whim, to falling in and out of love with suitors, cramming into roach-infested Hell’s Kitchen apartments, and eventually designing the chic, simple bag that would launch the pair to global fame. Through it all, Katy and Elyce’s friendship remained unshakeable. This powerful friendship lasted nearly forty years, until Katy’s tragic suicide in 2018. We Might Just Make It After All celebrates her legacy as a cultural icon and loyal friend.
