Ever feel like you're one group chat away from snapping?

You still care… but even the tiniest requests make you want to hide under a weighted blanket and never come out. You’re not a bad friend, partner, or parent... you’re just maxed out.

This free class is for midlife women who are quietly wondering:
✔️ Why am I so irritated by everyone right now?
✔️ Why do I keep saying yes when I’m already burnt out?
✔️ And why does connection feel like one more thing I have to manage?

Maybe you’ve always been the glue: the one who plans the thing, remembers the birthday, keeps everyone happy.

But lately, it feels like a role you’re performing, not a life you’re living. That’s not failure. That’s a sign something deeper is shifting.

We’ll explore...
✅ Why guilt, resentment, and people-fatigue are signs you've outgrown certain roles
✅ How midlife identity shifts (and yes, hormones too) are affecting your relationships
✅ What to do when you’re craving connection but also kinda want to delete your contacts list

Hi there! I'm Vicky, certified mindset & confidence coach, and I help women over 40 reinvent the second half of their lives by turning their so-called "midlife crisis" into a powerful journey of self-discovery, alignment, and purpose.

If you feel like you're alone in this journey, I promise you that you're not!

I’ve been in the rut, lived it, and clawed my way out. At 46, I got laid off from a 23-year career that shaped my entire identity. At 47, a minor health scare shook me awake. And by 49, I ended an 8-year relationship that was no longer working for me (and it was THE hardest decision I've ever made!).

Reinventing myself wasn’t a cute Pinterest project. It was survival.

Now, as I slide into 50 this year, I’m living proof that midlife isn’t a dead end; it’s the plot twist where you finally start living life your way. I’ve learned how to break free, redefine what matters, and make the rest of life the best of life, and I’m here to help you do the same.

Because life isn't winding down. You're just getting started!
