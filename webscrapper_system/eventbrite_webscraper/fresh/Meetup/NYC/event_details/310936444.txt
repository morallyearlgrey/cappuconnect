Please do NOT bring large amounts of food as we don't want any food to be wasted. Join us for a fun filled afternoon with good food and company. This is a family friendly event, so please feel free to bring your family with!

Please update your RSVP if you can no longer make it as we have a number limitation from park authorities.
