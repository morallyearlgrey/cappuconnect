Details

Come with questions about things you need help on. We'll be focusing on the basics, like stopping and turning. There will be no drills, just a chance for some one-on-one time to ask questions and get tips/pointers. These sessions are offered on an informal, volunteer basis. If you want more formal, advanced or personalized lessons, please contact one of the instructors on this list:
