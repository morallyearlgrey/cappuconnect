🤷‍♂️🌎Who is this meetup for?
Anyone who is learning a language and wants to practice speaking with native speakers and get tips from other learners!
All languages and levels are welcome!

🤷‍♂️🗣How it works:
Please look for an organizer when you arrive and we'll help you make a nametag and get seated :)

We usually gather around 1-3 tables depending on the languages people want to practice. Usually we get interest in English, Spanish, French & Chinese. Occasionally Portuguese, Japanese & more! If you comment with the language you want to practice, you have higher chances of practicing that language ✌

You should be spending about half the time practicing and half the time helping others ✌
