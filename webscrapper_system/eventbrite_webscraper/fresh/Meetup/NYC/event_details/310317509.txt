NYCYDC - General Meetup

Join fellow Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts at our fun and friendly meetup group! Whether you're a seasoned duelist or just starting out, our gatherings are the perfect place to trade cards, test your skills, and make new friends. We host regular events, tournaments, and casual play sessions, catering to all skill levels. Come for the cards, stay for the community! Let's duel and have a blast together!

FIRST TIMERS: we love introducing and inducting new members into our organization!

When you come in, find one of our members who will conduct a ceremonial entrance duel with you! Don’t worry about winning or losing. This is to give you the chance to jump right in and see what we’re about. You’ll then be added to our discord where Members organize duels, play, trade, and hang out.

You can also join our rankings as you work to become the next King of Games!

We look forward to seeing you!
