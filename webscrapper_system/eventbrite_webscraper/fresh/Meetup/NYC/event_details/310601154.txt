What
Happy Tuesday! Join other writers for an hour of focused writing -- outside, while the weather is nice!

"Be it a book, blog, script, essay, dissertation, resume, melody, poem or just plain work stuff, you are invited to write it with us. No one will see what you've written or give you unsolicited advice." Come and get it done.

Schedule
2:15 PM Look for group/sign.
2:30 Quick intros (names, writing projects)
2:45 Timer starts. Write for one hour. SUAW.
3:45 The end. Chat, take off, or keep writing.

* Please leave areas clean and organized for our host. Before/after meeting: Feel free to work in the common area until closing time! Hours.

Guidelines

Wi-Fi available
Socializing (optional) happens at the end. Writing is very solitary. Connecting (and sometimes even commiserating) with other writers is encouraged.
RSVP only if you can make it, and update ASAP if your plans change.
Running late? Join us quietly and start writing!

This is your practice and focus time, so we hope to see you there.

Happy Writing!
