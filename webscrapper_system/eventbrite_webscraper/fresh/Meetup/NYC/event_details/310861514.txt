NEW LOCATION: OMG NYC (Origami Meetup Group! New York City) is a group for people to come together and share in the beautiful art of Origami - an ancient art of folding various mediums, most commonly paper. The word comes from the combination of the Japanese verb oru (to fold) and the noun kami (paper). Other materials often folded are fabric, wire mesh, sheet metal, tissue, thin plastic, cardboard, and straws.

We meet as a group to teach each other new models and share paper, books, and tips. This meeting is free and open to all level of folders from beginners to advanced. There will be free paper available to share. You can bring your own paper and books, so you can just show up and fold! If you have models you would like to learn, or teach, let us know and we will try our best to accommodate.
