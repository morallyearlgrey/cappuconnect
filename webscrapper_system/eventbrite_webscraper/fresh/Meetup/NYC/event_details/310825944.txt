Join us as we play pickleball on a Sunday afternoon! This event will surely be a fun one, and itâ€™s also good exercise!

This event is for beginners. Please bring your own pickleball paddle and balls .

Bring water if you want to stay hydrated and snacks in case you get hungry.

Please be aware that since I am not able to reserve a court(s) in advance, we might have to wait for a court to open up!

We will meet at the pickleball courts, which are across the street from the Overpeck Park Amphitheater.
