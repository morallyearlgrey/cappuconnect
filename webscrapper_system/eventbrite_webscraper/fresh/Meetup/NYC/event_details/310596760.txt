The concept of our language exchange event is to provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for a gathering of folks to practice languages whilst making new friends and sharing experiences with people from all around the globe.

Please look for an organizer when you arrive and we'll help you make a nametag and get you seated.

The fee is to cover group costs: $3 (Cash or Venmo only)

Please note, this is a social event and not a dating event so please avoid any kind of interaction that may make other attendees feel uncomfortable. If you feel like someone is acting inappropriately, please approach one of the organizers so that we can handle it.

Sometimes we take photos at our events to preserve memory of our gatherings and for social media promotion.
