🤷‍♂️🌎Who is this meetup for?
Anyone who is learning a language and wants to practice speaking with native speakers and get tips from other learners!
All languages and levels are welcome!

🤷‍♂️🗣How it works:
Please look for an organizer when you arrive and we'll help you make a nametag and get seated :)

We will have several tables based on attendance, each table is for English + another language.
Our popular tables are: Spanish, Chinese, French, Japanese, German, Korean, and Russian.
We usually have tables for Italian and Portuguese and sometimes for Hebrew and Arabic.
If you speak or are learning a language that is not mentioned above we also will have a "General/Mix table" where you can hopefully find people that share your interests.
When you arrive please tell the organizers all of the languages you speak/practice that way we can help you find the right people or set up a table for you.
Commenting below with the languages you speak/practice significantly raises the chances of finding practice partners at the event!

You should be spending about half the time practicing and half the time helping others ✌

🤷‍♂️📌Where?
For the winter we will be at the 590 Madison Atrium (our indoor venue).
*Any decision to move the event location will be made on the morning of the event.*
If you have any questions please comment below!

💵 Suggested contribution $1+ from all attendees (Cash or Venmo @langroops or Pledge from this event page).
