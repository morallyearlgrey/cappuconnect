Dear Attendee,

Have you heard about Immanuel Kant and his famous work, The Critique of Pure Reason? If youâ€™re like me, youâ€™ve probably heard it mentioned as one of the most important pieces of philosophy since Plato. I was in this position about a year ago and decided that I should do a close reading of the work to better understand its significance.

So for about the past year, Iâ€™ve been slowly chipping away at itâ€”about 10 pages per week. Join me for a 30-minute presentation on my key takeaways from this work.

My goal is for someone who has never heard of Kant or read this piece to come away from my presentation with an understanding of the historical significance of the work, but more importantly, the structure of the Critique and the key messages and ideas from each part of it.

I look forward to having you attend.

Best,
Ryan Bohman
