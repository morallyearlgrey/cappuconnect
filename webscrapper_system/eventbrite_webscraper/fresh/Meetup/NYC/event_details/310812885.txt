What better way to finish a weekend than detox with a brisk Sunday morning run followed by some coffee and food in Central Park with great company.

Run with us and choose between a scenic 2, 3, or 4 mile loop around the southern portion of Central Park followed by some coffee and a bite to eat. All paces are welcome and encouraged.
