Details

This game is INTERMEDIATE - meaning it's a fun kickaround with a mix of skill levels but all players have experience. It's great for anyone looking for a quality game with laid-back people in a no-pressure environment. Not for beginners.

Please show up early so we can kick the game off in time.

Please bring a WHITE and DARK T shirt so we can divide up teams.

***

Format and Rules:

• Games are full field with 2 teams of 10 players, rotating goalkeepers, and full-sized nets. Everyone gets equal playing time and no one sits on the sidelines (unless you want a break).

• Feel Good games means that we don't play to win - we play to get a great workout, enjoy the friendly competition, and maybe even show off some skills :)

• No slide tackles or rough challenges allowed and no barking at other players. The goal is have a great game and leave with good vibes.

• As guests of Asphalt Green we must act responsibly at all times. Stay within the boundaries of our field, leave the field in better shape than you found it, and obey all instructions from Asphalt Green staff.
