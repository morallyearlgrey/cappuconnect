WEEK 212 of Tabletop Tuesdays | Sunnyside Game Night is ON!

SANGER HALL THIS WEEK

We will have plenty of games to choose from but always feel free to bring your own. We will be playing in the event space past the bar as you come into Sanger Hall.

These days, from 6:00-6:30, the group typically eats and catches up until 6:30 sharp when the week's games are pitched to the group.

We (and Sanger Hall) ask that anyone who comes to play makes a purchase of ~$15. They are a bar and gastropub.

Join the discord to pitch games you might want to play at https://discord.gg/qbnf9wPG3K

See you Tuesday!
