For this meeting we'll be at the home of a regular member named Ryan who hosted once before back in March. Huge thanks to him and his two roommates for once again welcoming us!

The night before we meet, I'll send out all the details to the people on the RSVP list, but for now, here are a few important things to keep in mind:

There are no pets.
There's an elevator, but it's not wheelchair accessible because there are several steps to get into the building.
There'll be a full hour at the start to arrive/hang before we begin quiet writing time.
There's not a ton of space, so I can't open THAT many slots. Therefore, if you RSVP (and this should always be the case), please honor that commitment. If you RSVP and can't make it, please un-RSVP as far in advance as possible so that someone on the wait list will be able to take your spot. Cool?
I love yoooou.
