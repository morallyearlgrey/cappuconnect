AI and the Future of Work Tickets, Tue, Oct 7, 2025 at 6:30 PM | Eventbrite

Artificial Intelligence is developing at breakneck speed, causing much anxiety about how our society and daily lives may change in the not-too-distant future. Top of mind for many: jobs. A panel of experts brings the speculation down to earth, addressing questions such as: What jobs will AI replace? What new jobs will be created? How will AI affect workplace conditions, wages, unions, and the overall economy? Featuring Daron Acemoglu, Nobel laureate and professor of economics at MIT; Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate, former New York Times columnist, and distinguished professor of economics at the CUNY Graduate Center; Danielle Li, David Sarnoff Professor of Management of Technology at MIT; Zeynep Tufecki, professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University and a New York Times columnist; and others. Moderated by Steven Greenhouse, former New York Times labor reporter and author of Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor.

CFI-NYC will go out for an inexpensive dinner nearby after the event.
