Join us for our new Midtown Meetup! This first time we will meet with the group in-person at Bryant Park--weather permitting. We will be in the seating right off of 6th Ave. The host Kim will make a sign so participants can find the group at one of the table seating areas. Come grab a drink, yarn, and some food at nearby venues!

If the weather is bad, we will move indoors to one of the restaurants on 40th St.

We are primarily a knitting/crocheting/fibre arts group, but any and all crafters are welcome to join, as well as anyone looking to learn how to knit/crochet! ðŸ§¶Come and make new crafty friends, work through a project challenge or just stay warm with hot cocoa in your Stanley cup. *coughs* Cocoa.
