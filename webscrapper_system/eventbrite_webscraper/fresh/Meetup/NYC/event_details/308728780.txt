In this lecture DiCarlo will talk about three things. First, he will review the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) so that everyone is roughly on the same page in reference to key terms, concepts, and issues. Second, he will explain some of the promising benefits and potential harms that such new technologies will bring to humanity. And finally, he will talk about what you, member of the public, can do to help mitigate the risks of AI. His recently published book, Building A God, will be discussed during his presentation.
