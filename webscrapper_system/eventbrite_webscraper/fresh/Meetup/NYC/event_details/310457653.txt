The New York Historical invites you to the Reading Room of the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library!

Even though we are meeting in the museum's library, there will not be books available for you to read. Please bring your own book.

Although the name of the group is Silent Book Club, people are free to chit chat with each other. As long as no one is causing a commotion, no one will be shushed.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR FINDING THE GROUP INSIDE THE NY HISTORICAL

Enter the building through the Central Park West entrance and go through Admissions, where you will get an entry sticker.
You may be asked for a donation but itâ€™s Pay As You Wish so you may pay as much or as little as you like.
Once you get the sticker, you may head up the grand staircase opposite Admissions.
As soon as you get to the second floor, you'll see the entrance to the Reading Room on the left. We'll have a sign noting the room is reserved for Silent Book Club.

Readers are welcome to hang out in the Museum until closing at 8:00 PM.
