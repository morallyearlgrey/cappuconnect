Details

Join us for an unforgettable day of scenic trails and savory bites!
We’re heading out on Sunday, September 21st for a beautiful hike along the Diamond Mountain Trail in Harriman State Park—known for its quiet forest paths, rolling ridgelines, and panoramic views. This moderate loop is the perfect mix of peaceful woods and rewarding outlooks, especially with the first hints of fall color creeping into the trees.

After the hike, we’ll treat ourselves to a well-deserved feast at Mt. Fuji Restaurant—a Japanese steakhouse perched on a mountain with sweeping views of the Hudson Valley. Whether you're craving sushi, sizzling hibachi, or just a killer view with a drink in hand, this post-hike stop is a vibe.
