This is a free event and only rain can stop us!

Time for some bush walk verticals! This time we will go to Dover Stone Church and Nellie Hill preserves.
We will pass through rivers, creeks, waterfall, cave and have a lunch by the top of the mountain.
If we will have enough time we will visit Roger Perry Memorial preserve as well.
This is a loop walk!
