Join us at Hack Manhattan for Software Freedom Day 2025, where we will help teach attendees about software freedom, reclaiming our tech, and alternatives to many proprietary systems and software. Bring laptops and phones and we can show you how to install systems like LineageOS, GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, and others on your mobile devices, and how to install and use Linux on your older laptops to keep them alive.
