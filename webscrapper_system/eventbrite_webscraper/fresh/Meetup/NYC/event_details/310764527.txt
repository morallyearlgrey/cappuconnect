A lot of folks asked for a second monthly meeting, so here it is! Join us on the last Wednesday of every month for our in-person fiber arts meet up! Whether you knit, crochet, felt, sew, cross-stitch, or embroider, come by, grab a drink or a snack, and share your creations!

We meet in the food hall at Brookfield Place (230 Vesey St) in Tribeca. We usually have a sign on the table so you can find us.
