Details

SpeakIt is a group where the goal is to practice and learn languages naturally: By talking and meeting new people! 🥳 this, of course, includes English learners 😍.
Traducción

We hope to have all the cultures that New York City represents, so we welcome any language and all language levels. Here's how it works:

👨‍🎓You spend part of your time practicing a language you are learning;
🧑🏻‍🏫You spend the other part of your time speaking in your native language, helping others! (even if you only speak one language, that's fine)

When you arrive at the venue, we will have flag stickers 🇺🇳 representing any country of your choosing. Put your most fluent language on top and any language(s) you are learning or already know below. Then find someone else wearing a flag and say hi in your preferred language 👋🏼.

FAQ's

💰Event is $2 (suggested, cash or Venmo) to help cover the cost for the flags and the meetup subscription.
🍻Please support the venue that hosts us by ordering something from the bar. 😎
Will there be [x] language speakers here? That depends! Some more likely than others. We don't organize who comes to the event, so we can't be 100% sure your language will be there. You may want to invite a practice buddy. Otherwise come say Hi and find out!
Can I show up late? Show up any time during the event.
Coming alone? Welcome! Just bring a friendly face and some words.
Or feel free to bring along some friends, too.
