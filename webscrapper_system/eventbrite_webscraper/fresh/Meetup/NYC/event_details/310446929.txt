Join us by Zoom to meet with other adults with ADHD. Discuss challenges, successes and solutions. This meeting is a casual conversation with our tribe. If you want to contribute to the conversation feel free, if not, feel comfortable just listening. Members share, ask questions and have a few laughs while learning about ADHD/ADD.
