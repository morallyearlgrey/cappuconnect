Details

You meet someone new.
It feels exciting. Familiar. Intense.
But a few weeks later, it unravels in precisely the same way as the last one.

Sound familiar?

In this Soulmated session, we’re exploring the hidden patterns that shape who we’re drawn to, how we show up, and why we sometimes chase connection that feels predictable but not necessarily right.

This isn’t about blame.
It’s about awakening.

We’ll look at:

The difference between chemistry and compatibility
How your attachment style and past relationships may be steering your choices
Why some “types” feel irresistible (even when they’re unavailable)
Signs you’re stuck in a loop—and how to break it
What it actually means to date with intention and possibility

If you’ve ever asked yourself:

> “Why do I keep attracting the same kind of person?”

> “Why do I feel bored with healthy connections?”

> “Is it me… or is it them?”

This session is for you.
