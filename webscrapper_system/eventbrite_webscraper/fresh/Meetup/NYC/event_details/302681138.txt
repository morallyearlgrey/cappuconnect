NYC Rollerbladers held our first event on Oct. 1, 2023 at Randall's Island. Those in attendance were Matt, Trudi, Phylicia, Gilbert, Daniela, Bimbola, Jyllian, Kim, Nayarett, and Carlos. Our group now has over 1000 members on Meetup and over 600 on Whatsapp. This event will mark our two year anniversary.

Meet on Randall's Island at bus stop "Main Roadway/Icahn Stadium."

How to get there: Take the 6 train to 125th St stop. Walk to M35 bus stop at Lexington Avenue and 125th St. (right by the subway). Take M35 bus to "Main Roadway/Icahn Stadium" stop (5 stops).

Note: This is a beginner event but not an absolute beginner event. You should at least be able to stand on skates, move from one place to another, and brake (not T-stop necessarily, but at least plow stop). We will go slow and help at steeper inclines/in general.

We will do two to three loops around the bottom half of the island (see map below). One loop is 2.2 miles. We will also skate from the meeting point to the loop entrance (0.3 miles). Total skate mileage is about 5.
