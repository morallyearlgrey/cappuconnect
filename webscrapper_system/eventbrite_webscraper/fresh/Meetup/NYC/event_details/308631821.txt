Welcome to the first annual NYC Philosophy & Psychology Readers Conference!

Since 2019 this meetup group has enabled readers of philosophy and psychology to come together to form friendships and foster insights by engaging in thoughtful discussions on significant concepts discovered from reading books and intellectual consumption.

Now, we’re taking it to the next level — join us for a full-day conference where community members will share their insights through a series of talks and lively social interactions.

### ❗ IMPORTANT RSVP INFO
