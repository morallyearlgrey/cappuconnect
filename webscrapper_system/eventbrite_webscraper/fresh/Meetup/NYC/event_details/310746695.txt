Hi all!

Thanks so much to everyone who came last night- it was a lively discussion and a great turnout. As recommended by one of our members (Tory), this next book club we'll be reading "All Fours" by Miranda July.

If anyone has suggestions for books to read in the coming months, please message them to me.

Hope to see you soon!

Rebecca
