Details

We will be heading to 21 Golf Range in Palisades Park.

Meeting place:
Lobby; We will try to wait for about 5-10 minutes. If you come after this time, you could ask them where's the Meetup group or look on the second floor. Please note that hosts will be participating in the activity and may not be checking their phone after this 5-10 minute period. Also, please be sure to dress for the weather in case it gets cooler. While the golf range is sheltered, its open to the outdoors. If you RSVP but are not coming, please update it for the sake of those that can make it, thanks üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

Price:
For 1 hour it is $20 per person with unlimited balls however if you would like to play for a shorter or longer period of time, please visit their website for their other rates: https://21golfrange.com/pages/rates üòäPlease note that you are not required to stay the entire event time however be sure to pay your portion especially if you are matched up at a bay with other members of the group. Please have either cash, card, Zelle, Venmo, etc ready in case split pay is required.

Golf Clubs:
If you want to rent a club, it is $5 for two but you should be able to bring your own if you have them.

Bay Placements:
Since it's first come first serve (they don't take reservations), we'll be placed in whatever bays are available, so it's very likely the group will be split up so please be prepared in case this happens. If you happen to come later on, we will most likely be upstairs and look for co-host Randy or Jessica with the dreads (however I may leave early), OR you can ask the front that you are looking for a Meetup group.

Parking: They have a parking lot

Food/After:
There are restaurants nearby. If you would like to eat after the event, there is a Mexican restaurant that Randy suggests: https://cantina46nj.com/. 21 Golf also says that they have a cafe that sells hot/iced coffee, water, Gatorade, snacks & more.
