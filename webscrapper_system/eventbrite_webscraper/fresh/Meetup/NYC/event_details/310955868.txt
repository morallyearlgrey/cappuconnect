With the Fall race training season upon us, we will be hitting the streets and bridges of New York City for a 15-mile run.

The route starts on the north side of Oculus on Vesey St near WTC. We will then embark on Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, Kosciuszko, Greenpoint Ave, Pulaski and Queensboro Bridge. More information about pace groups to be announced closer to the event. Here is the map:

This will be a challenging route, so if you wish to go shorter please plan accordingly to stop near any subway station.

We will meet at 7:00AM at Grove PATH to take the 7:07AM WTC train or at 6:55AM at JSQ to take the 7:02AM into the city. We will regroup/meet at the top of the stairs after the turnstiles in the WTC PATH station.

Finally, if you choose to end your run early, please let one of your wave hosts know.
