Hope everyone is excited to get our running group back together!!

We will host runs every-other week on Saturday mornings! Typically, we run along the waterfront through Astoria Park, however keep an eye out as we will sometimes meet at various locations throughout NYC!

Runners (or walkers, or joggers haha) of all levels are welcome!! We start off with a prayer and light stretching, and end the event by gathering for breakfast and coffee at a local cafe!

Participation is at your own risk, please make sure that you participate in a safe and controlled manner. By attending this event, you agree to be in photos/video which may be used for group promotion.

Hope to meet many new friends, and reconnect with old ones too :)
