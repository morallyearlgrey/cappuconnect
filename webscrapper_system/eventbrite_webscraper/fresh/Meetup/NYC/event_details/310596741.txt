🌎 Connect, Speak, Enjoy – Language Exchange in NYC! ✨
Looking for a fun and relaxed way to practice languages and meet people from around the world? Come join our international community for an evening full of great conversations and cultural exchange!
It’s the perfect place to expand your circle, meet like-minded people, and build friendships across cultures.
All levels and backgrounds welcome — just drop in!

🎲 It’s a spontaneous, drop-in event, so we don’t control who shows up or which languages will be spoken.

English, Spanish, Russian, French, Japanese, Italian, and Mandarin are commonly heard, but the mix changes week to week.

Here’s how it works:
– Tell us the languages you speak and want to practice when you arrive
– We’ll help you make a name-tag and introduce you to a group
– Spend part of the time practicing your target language, and part helping others with yours!

🎟️ $3 contribution (cash or Venmo) — helps us cover the costs and keep the event going.
Please support the venue that hosts us by purchasing at least one drink or food item.

📸 We occasionally take casual photos to share the good vibes and promote future events — we’ll always try to let you know before snapping any pictures.

No lessons. No pressure. Just great conversations, new friends, and global vibes.
