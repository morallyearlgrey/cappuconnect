Our September social is here!

Join us at 2:00 p.m. at the Museum of the Moving Image (36-01 35th Ave, Astoria) for Jim Henson’s birthday weekend celebration 🎉🐸. We can plan to meet in the lobby and then make our way through the exhibits. Folks can come and go as they please.

We’ll hang out at the museum for an hour or two, then head over to Pig Beach for drinks and food. Apparently, there will also be some Henson-themed things happening there too :)

MoMI offers a variety of ticket discounts and free entry options:

Come for the muppets, stay for the good company. Hope to see you there.
