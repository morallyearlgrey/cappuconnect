We play all types of games, but lean a little towards social deduction and lighter games.
NEW TO THE MEETUP?
Thanks for coming! We hope you enjoy yourself. We are a social, friendly group that meets to play games. Language and behavior that is racist, sexist, ableist, ageist, and so on, is not tolerated. Bullying and bad-mouthing the other guests or hosts are also not tolerated. We're not here to debate politics, and we are not a dating service. Obviously gaming can sometimes include trash talking. Just … know if your opponents are up for that! And look, we all make mistakes -- if you’ve offended someone, an apology can go a long way. Please don’t use this game day to try to raise money for your business.
