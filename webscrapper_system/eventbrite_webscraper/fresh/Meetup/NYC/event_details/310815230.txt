Why is Navratri celebrated ?
Navratri, rooted in ancient Hindu mythology and history, holds a significant place in India's cultural and religious heritage. The history of Navratri dates back thousands of years and is steeped in legend and tradition.

One of the most famous stories associated with Navratri is the battle between the goddess Durga and the demon Mahishasura. According to Hindu mythology, Mahishasura, a shape-shifting demon, terrorized the heavens and the earth. Unable to bear his tyranny, the gods created the goddess Durga, an embodiment of their collective divine power, to defeat Mahishasura. This epic battle lasted for nine days and nights, symbolizing the nine nights of Navratri. On the tenth day, known as Vijayadashami or Dussehra, Durga emerged victorious, marking the triumph of good over evil. Navratri also celebrates the goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and wisdom, during this period. Each of the nine nights is dedicated to one of these goddesses, with special prayers and rituals performed to invoke their blessings.

Over the centuries, Navratri has evolved from a primarily religious observance into a grand cultural festival. It is a time when people come together to dance the energetic Garba and Dandiya Raas, wearing traditional attire and forming intricate dance circles. These dances symbolize the joyous celebration of life, as well as the triumph of light over darkness.

Today, Navratri transcends religious boundaries and is celebrated by people of various backgrounds, not only in India but also in Indian communities worldwide. It's a testament to the enduring power of tradition and the significance of preserving cultural heritage in a modern world. Navratri continues to be a time of unity, devotion, and festivity, honoring the ancient legends and history that make it a cherished part of Indian culture.
