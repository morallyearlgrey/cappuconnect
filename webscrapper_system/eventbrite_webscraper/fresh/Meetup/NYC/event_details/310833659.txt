Join us for our next Knit+Wine Night on Sunday, September 28th from 5-7:00pm. Please note that space is limited to 15 people.

For those of you who are new to Knit+Wine Night, this is an informal community event for knitters (& other crafters and textile enthusiasts) to come together to work on their own projects and enjoy the company of other makers. All types of knitters, crocheters, and fiber crafters are welcome! This is *not* a class.

The cafe has a focused menu of beverages, including tea, coffee, beer, wine, and cocktails, and a small selection of pastries. Please note you must make a purchase in order to enter the cafe. The staff is wonderful and welcoming!

NOTE a change in the way you sign up. Historically we have had too many who sign up and not show up. In order to accommodate all who intend to participate your $3.00 payment must be made to reserve your space. Those who do not will be relieved from the attendee column and a waitlist paying participant will be moved up. Venmo @Anouche-Mardirossian.

(BTW if you are new to the group and wondering why there is a small registration fee, it's to help offset the fees MeetUp charges event organizers to use their website. It does not go towards food & drink purchases. Nor my own wallet :).
