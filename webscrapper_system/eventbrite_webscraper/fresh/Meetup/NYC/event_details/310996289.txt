Back to NYC - Join me & Lennie as we head back to NYC and the High Line and Governors Island.
Guest allowed with Leader approval!

The High Line is a public park built on a historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattanâ€™s West Side. It runs from Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District to West 34th Street, between 10th and 12th Avenues. Here's a link to a web site.

We'll start on the corner of 8th & West 31st in front of Madison Square Garden at 9:45 am (the post office is across the street. Click on the map link to the pin location.) I'll be taking the train from Hamilton to Penn Station to get here. See below for those that want to come along.

From here we'll start on the northern end of the High Line and walk it south. When we get off that, we'll head on down through Greenwich Village and make our way to the World Trade Center. We'll hang out here for a bit. The Museum is open but we wont be going in on this trip. The lines are long to get in. Maybe another trip for that.

After the World Trade Center we'll make our way to the southern end of Manhattan to Battery Park. When there we'll get on the ferry to Governers Island. (The 1pm ferry - See below for ticket info)

Once on the island, we'll do a self tour. Lots of culture there. And it's a great place for lunch. There are places to buy food and drink or bring your own. We'll hang out there for a while then head back to Manhatten. Then back to Penn Station and me and Lennie will grab a bite to eat before heading home.

Here's the timeline...
Lennie & I will be taking the train from the Hamiliton Station (by trenton) to Penn Station. We're going to grab either the 7:24 am or the 8:04 am train. The later train (8:04 am) get us to Penn Station at 9:32 am. It's about 1-1/2 hour train ride with all the stops. Here's a link to the train schedules. You can purchase tickets at the station in the ticket machines.

Meet at the starting point at 9:45 am in NYC.
We'll Head to high line and down to Battery Park. This is about 4-1/2 miles and then we'll grab the 1 pm ferry to Governors Island (it runs every half hour). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to pre-purchase ferry tickets online (5.00 each round trip) as there's no guarantee for walk on's.

This is a long day of walking. 10-12 miles, an easy walk but on concrete. Again, you can bail anytime. If you hang all day including dinner, plan on getting back well into the evening.

Wear comfortable walking shoes. Bring lunch and plenty of water.

Make sure you arrive at the station to allow time to buy tickets and board the train. They run approx every 30-40 minutes.
