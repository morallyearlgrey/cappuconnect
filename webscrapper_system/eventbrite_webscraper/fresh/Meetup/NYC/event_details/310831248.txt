Each month, the Human Rights Foundation and PubKey dive into how Freedom Tech and Bitcoin advance humanitarian goals.

In this fireside chat, HRF’s Director of Financial Freedom CK will discuss the intersection of Bitcoin and AI with Matt Ahlborg, the Bitcoin researcher, entrepreneur, and creator of PayPerQ. PayPerQ allows users to easily access powerful generative AI models (like ChatGPT or Claude) with Bitcoin Lightning payments, making the service more accessible globally to those without traditional payment methods. Bitcoin-integrated AI such as PayPerQ also enhances user privacy by not requiring identifying information such as a name, credit card, or email address.

Join this conversation to learn about how Bitcoin interacts with AI to support human rights, and participate in a live audience Q&A with the speakers!

​​​As always, this is a FREE and PUBLIC event! 🧡🍻🙏
