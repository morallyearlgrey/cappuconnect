Back in the days labor market data was boring but reliable. That era is officially over. We're living through some fascinating times. Predictions about job displacement range from "robots will take our jobs" to "nothing will change." Economic volatility makes your quarterly forecasts look like astrology, and the BLS is... well, let's just say private sector data might be doing the heavy lifting soon.

Join us for a very timely discussion with three experts:

Gad Levanon, Chief Economist, The Burning Glass Institute
Loujaina Abdelwahed, Senior Economist, Revelio Labs
Carla Garcia Williams, Senior Director @ Visier Inc.

Some of the topics we're planning on talking about:

AI's actual job impact (timeline / reality check)
Volatility, tariffs, and what that means for workforce models
Revelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS) and other private data sources filling government gaps

Looking forward to this conversation! Bring hard questions. These panelists can handle them!
