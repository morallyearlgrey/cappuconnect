From Dream to Done: Making It Real, One Step at a Time
This is the follow-up workshop to our live podcast where we move from inspiration into action (you can request a download here). Together, we‚Äôll take a hands-on look at how to break down your vision into clear steps, build supportive systems, and keep momentum alive even when challenges arise.
In this session, you‚Äôll be guided through short reflections to uncover what‚Äôs holding you back and where to focus your energy next:

We encourage you to reflect over the below:

Say No with Purpose ‚Äì What drains your time, energy, or focus? What supportive habits could replace them? (Bonus: revisit your Month 2 commitments and schedule habits that reinforce your future self.)
Map the Path Forward ‚Äì Break your vision into specific, measurable steps. Define resources, timelines, and ways to recharge as you progress.
Face What‚Äôs Sticking ‚Äì Where do you still feel hesitation or fear? What solutions, support, or mindset shifts could help you stay committed ‚Äî and even find joy ‚Äî in the process?

Join Shanti and Tatiana for a hands-on workshop about self-honesty, limiting beliefs and how to align your actions with your trues self building confidence and worthiness.
