AWOL (After Work Origami Lovers) with us at Whole Foods on Madison Avenue and East 28th Street, UPSTAIRS in the dining area.

After a long week what could be better than meeting with friends and potential new friends to fold your work week away!

It should be a lot of fun and more intimate than our once a month big meetings. A great place to learn some new models and also get help on models you're been stuck on. Bring your latest folds and creations for show and tell and your favorite models to teach and learn.

This meeting is free and open to all level of folders from beginners to advanced folders. Bring paper and your books and also there will always be free paper available so you can just show up and fold!

Please try to RSVP so others will know you will be there. Hope to see you there! Happy folding!!
