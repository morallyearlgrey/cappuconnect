Fall is in the air! Come join us for soccer on Sunday afternoons, all are welcome! The majority of our players are beginners or intermediate, so please don't be shy if you've never played before. We start off our events with prayer and warm-ups, then will divide up the teams and play a game! While we enjoy friendly competition, we also strive to make our events family-friendly and comfortable for everyone to join :)

All play is at your own risk. Please inspect the field prior to playing and make sure that you play in a safe and controlled manner. By attending this event, you agree to be in photos/video which may be used for group promotion.

Water will be provided, but please bring a bottle to fill up. Note that times and fields vary each event, so please check.
