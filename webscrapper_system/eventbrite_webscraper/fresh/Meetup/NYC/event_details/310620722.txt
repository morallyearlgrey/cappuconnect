Crisp air. Golden leaves. Baskets of apples waiting to be picked. This fall day is all about slowing down, soaking up the season, and sharing good vibes with good people.

We’ll wander the orchards, fill our baskets, snap some amazing photos, and enjoy fall treats along the way. Whether you come solo, with friends, or to meet new faces, this is the perfect way to connect while keeping it light and easy.

Pro tip: Bring a tote or basket, wear something comfy and cozy, and don’t forget your camera for those autumn-worthy shots.
