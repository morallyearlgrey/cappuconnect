Remember when pitching was fun? No battles or competitions, no celebrity VCs, no make-or-break stress.

We're bringing back low-pressure pitch events for early-stage startups that just need to get their ideas out into the world and hear constructive feedback from fellow founders in the trenches.

This is your chance to see the newest startups coming out of the NYC ecosystem. You're getting a first look at fresh ideas, sometimes even before VCs have seen them!
