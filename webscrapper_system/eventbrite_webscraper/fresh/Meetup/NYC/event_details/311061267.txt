Featured Speaker: Amir Kirsh
Talk Title: Refactoring C++ Code
Description
Writing C++ code is one thing, keeping it clean, readable and maintainable over time is another. In this talk, we'll review the basics of refactoring C++ code, focusing on strategies to improve code clarity, reduce duplication, and make your code easier to maintain. We will also explore how to modernize your code by leveraging new C++ features when relevant. Refactoring code has become quite essential nowadays, as AI starts generating bigger parts of our codebase, requiring, in many cases, rework of our code to enhance clarity, reduce complexity, and improve long-term maintainability. The talk will include a few code examples for discussion. Participants will be encouraged to actively participate in identifying code smells and potentials for meaningful refactoring options.
