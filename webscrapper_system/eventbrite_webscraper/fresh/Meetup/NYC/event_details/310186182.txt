Details

Art & Craftsthetic is a small group of crafty, artistic people who have been meeting together for a few years. We've joined meetup to expand our network and find likeminded people. Come join us and bring whatever you are currently working on. Any and all arts and crafts are welcome, as are any level or skillset.

Please note: RSVPS open two weeks before each event and are closed when the link is sent to attendees.

Group Description:
Are you looking for a space to dive into the rhythm of making, where creativity and practicality intertwine? Are you looking for a space with open minds willing to help? Or do you just want a chat as you grind through a project?

Art & Craftsthetic is the space for people like you. It’s for you-- who is passionate about creating. It’s for you—who is eager to share support while working through your own creative pain points. It’s for you—who enjoys spending time with others while they work on their project. Whether you see yourself as an artist or a crafter, this is a warm space where failure is embraced, new ideas are welcomed, and you will be encouraged to try new things or dive deep into the details of art or craft you love most.

This is our Craftsthetic and we welcome you to join our community of art and crafting. Stay as long as you want. Bring projects in any point in progress. Take home the wisdom and insight of fellow creative people like yourself.
