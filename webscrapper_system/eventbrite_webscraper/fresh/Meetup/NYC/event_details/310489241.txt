Mountaineering Club of New York – Skills Session: Crevasse Rescue & Rope Techniques
📍 Central Park – Summit Rock (Google Maps Link)
🕙 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM
Join the Mountaineering Club of New York for a hands-on refresher focused on crevasse rescue techniques and essential rope skills—right in the heart of Central Park. Whether you're prepping for a glacier expedition or just looking to stay sharp, this session is designed for all skill levels.

We’ll cover*:
🧗‍♂️ 2:1, 3:1, and 6:1 hauling systems
🪢 Basic knots and friction hitches
🧵 Rope team travel

We suggest wearing comfortable clothes you don't mind getting a little dirty, as a lot of the rope work is done from a kneeling position in the grass.
If you have a harness, carabiners (ideally 4 non-lockers and 4 lockers), or even a rope, feel free to bring them - we'll have some extra harnesses and carabiners as well, so don't worry if you don't have those things.

Otherwise, the only thing you'll need is a sense of adventure! No snow required—just imagination and some open grass.

*While some members of the club have been trained by guides we are not a professional guiding service and are not providing an alternative to formal training in safe mountaineering practices. Please seek formal training before attempting glacier travel.
