Welcome Witches!

This group meets once a month for an hour and a half on Mondays from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. It is a group designed to share with other witches and spiritually minded individuals your personal gains from your spiritual path.

Be prepared to talk about spells, rituals, sabbats, and psychic abilities. And personal growth.

This gathering is designed to support you on your journey of spiritual growth. It is also another means of support to use along with Witch's Magickal Manifesting Masterclass.

So, bring a journal, a cup of warmth, and an open heart.

Topics include manifesting, law of attraction, psychic abilities, fairies, spells, herbs, and co-creating with the universe. Also, healing and personal development in the spiritual realm.

Once you RSVP, purchase your ticket below, and a Zoom link will be sent to you.
