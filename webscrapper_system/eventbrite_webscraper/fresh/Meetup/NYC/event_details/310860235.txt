Welcome to our weekly Board Game Nights at Bryant Park! Join us every Tuesday from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM at Bryant Park, located on 40th St between 5th and 6th Avenue. If it rains we will move to the Bryant Park Reading Room where there are giant umbrellas covering the tables.

We will have a good selection of games but if you have a game you want to bring, please do! We will have Codenames, Werewords, Azul, Avalon, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, and many more games.

Don't worry if you're coming alone – our friendly group is always open to new members, and our experienced hosts are more than happy to introduce you to the rules of any game you're interested in trying.

NEW TO THE MEETUP?
Thanks for coming! We hope you enjoy yourself. We are a social, friendly group that meets to play games. Language and behavior that is racist, sexist, ableist, ageist, and so on, is not tolerated. Bullying and bad-mouthing the other guests are also not tolerated. We're not here to debate politics, and we are not a dating service. Obviously gaming can sometimes include trash talking. Just … know if your opponents are up for that! And look, we all make mistakes -- if you’ve offended someone, an apology can go a long way.
