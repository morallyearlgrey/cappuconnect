Only heavy rain can stop us!

Dear verticals, It's time to enjoy the beautiful foliage of Bear mountain.
We go through the red, blue and white trails.
Part of it goes through Appalachian and Popolopen Gorge trails. We will pass through Fort Clinton, Hessian lake, Stone cottages, Perkins Memorial tower and many other sights.
