THIS EVENT IS IN DANGER OF BEING CANCELED WHEN WE DON'T HAVE HOSTS. We're looking for hosts to host this event once a month or every other if that's what you can do. Message Aleksandra.

~ Dinner and Board Games at Zeppelin Hall ~
RSVP on the Bunch app - [LetsBunch.com](https://www.letsbunch.com) - where members who rsvp will be connected with other members that rsvp automatically and can set up follow-up group hangouts with them - all free.

This event is FREE.

Join us for our weekly dinner and board games at Zeppelin Hall. With Zeppelin Hall you can simply order your food at the window and join our table for some games and conversation.

To connect with our members outside of meetup events, download our app https://www.letsbunch.com. It is completely free and lets you setup coffee, dinner, lunch, etc with our members - a small Bunchüçì at a time ‚ò∫Ô∏è. We created it for our New Jersey community.

We're a laid back social group! We're less into board games and more into socializing. Please, no strict-rulers here. We like to relax and have fun. If there are any disputes over the rules, which we prefer to be easily agreed upon by yourselves at the table, our host will have the final say.

We expect everyone to conduct themselves in a kind and friendly manner.

All ages welcome and all ages do come!

All my best and see you at the next one!
Aleksandra
