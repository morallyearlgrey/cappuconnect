Help make freeganism happen in NYC! At our organizational meetings we discuss and decide on future activities and group direction. Participants are encouraged to step up and introduce new freegan projects with the support of the group, or take roles such as facilitating meetings or bottom-lining events. We welcome both those with experience taking part in non-hierarchical consensus-based groups and those participating for the first time.

Then at 9pm, we will have a brief, newcomer-friendly discussion about freeganism before exploring the area’s wasted food and other goods. We give advice on how to salvage these goods, and comment on the reasons for such waste.

When & Where: For the meeting, come at 7:30pm to the public seating area, called the Hugh food hall, inside the entrance of Citigroup Center, 157 E 53rd St, Manhattan. For the Freeganism 101 and beginning of the Trash Tour, meet us at 9pm in the same location.
If you have trouble finding us, call or text Janet at ‭(347) 724-6954‬.
