Details

Come meet some board game designers, play some unreleased games, and maybe even make some new friends!

NOTE: GUMBO has recently expanded into a new events space in 305. The space is LARGER than our prior 313 space so we have more spots open!

Come up to 305 (3rd floor, turn RIGHT once you get out of elevators)! If locked out, CALL â€ª(718) 819-7754 (do not text)

If you just want to play some games...RSVP and show up! Attendance will be taken so if you RSVP, please try to attend. Repeat no-shows will be waitlisted for future events.

If you want to playtest YOUR game...RSVP, FILL out this form prior to the event (LINK HERE), and pay a $10 fee HERE (helps cover GUMBO expenses such as electricity, cleanup, etc.). Your spot is not confirmed until payment is made.

If the spots are full, you are welcome to come as playtester but we not be able to playtest your game.

GUMBO Patreon Members (here) have priority access and can playtest their games for free!

If you would like to stay updated about future NYC playtesting events, we created a new discord channel: https://discord.gg/8xArPjKpqk
