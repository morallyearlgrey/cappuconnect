Drinking Skeptically promotes fellowship and networking among skeptics, critical-thinkers, and like-minded individuals in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. We discuss the issues of the day and whatever else is on our minds. But most of all, we have fun!

Don't drink? Don't let that stop you from joining; we are happy to have you! Visiting New York from out of town? Stop on by! Skeptics are a friendly bunch and there's always room for one more...

See you there!
