Only two more Vegan Drinks left for 2025! If you’re looking to make new vegan friends and get acquainted with familiar faces, Vegan Drinks is the place to be!

September’s edition of Vegan Drinks will be treated by special private chef Mariana Tamiozzy for our food vendor and benefitting food justice nonprofit, Food Empowerment Project.

Start out the autumn season 🎃🍁🍂 right with a nightout with fellow vegans in NYC’s LES.

*The venue offers a full selection of alcoholic and alcohol-free beverages*

📍 Mark your calendars and bring your friends!
