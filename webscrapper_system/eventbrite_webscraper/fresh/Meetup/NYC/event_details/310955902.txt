We will meet in front of 25 Haus (25 Christopher Columbus Dr) at 830am SHARP to take a team photo. Corrals close at 850am, so we want give runners enough time to warm up.

Everyone is strongly encouraged to wear JCR gear if you have any.

JCR who are not running the race are also strongly encouraged to come for the team photo.
