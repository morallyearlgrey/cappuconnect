Join us to connect with other Christians working in tech in NYC!

Whether you're a developer, designer, founder, product manager, salesperson—or exploring a career move—this is a space to build real connections at the intersection of faith and technology.

Come ready to encourage others, share a challenge, or offer a skill or advice. We especially welcome those navigating career transitions, within or into tech.

We close every meetup asking, "How can I pray for you?"
