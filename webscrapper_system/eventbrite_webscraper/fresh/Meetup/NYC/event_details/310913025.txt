Due to the overwhelming number of requests to repeat this event, we are having an Encore Presentation -- if you missed the first one, please join us! PDF Workbook - I created a 14 page fillable Workbook for this presentation; please follow the link to my MEGA drive and download it!
Spiritual Awakening and the Dark Night of the Soul—a sacred journey that many of us experience on our path to higher consciousness. In this presentation, we will explore the profound, often challenging, yet deeply transformative experience known as the "Dark Night"—and how it leads to spiritual rebirth and awakening.

What is the Dark Night of the Soul? (Quiz - What Stage Are you in?)
The Dark Night of the Soul is a phase in our spiritual journey where we face deep inner turmoil, loss, confusion, or disillusionment. Often, it's accompanied by a complete dismantling of everything that we thought was important to our lives. It is a process of shedding old identities, beliefs, and attachments in order to step into our higher selves and divine purpose. This period may feel isolating and painful, but it is actually a sacred initiation that guides us toward profound self-realization and connection with the Divine.
Spiritual Awakening: The Path to Inner Illumination
While the Dark Night can feel like an overwhelming abyss, it is also the doorway to spiritual awakening. This presentation will guide you through understanding the awakening process—the shifts in perception, the deepening of intuition, and the call to reconnect with your soul's true essence. It’s a reminder that even in our darkest moments, we are being reborn into the light of our highest truth.

We’ll explore some practical steps for navigating spiritual awakening, from recognizing the signs of a shift in consciousness to integrating the lessons of the Dark Night. Through techniques like mindfulness, meditation, and energy healing, we can learn how to embrace this journey as part of our soul’s evolution. We will finish with a group meditation.

This gathering is perfect for those experiencing or curious about spiritual awakening, those walking through their own Dark Night, or anyone seeking deeper clarity and peace during moments of personal transformation.
