Do you ever feel like no matter how hard you work or how much you try, something unseen keeps holding you back?

In this introductory session, we’ll explore how "baggage"; energy blockages from things like limiting beliefs, cross purposes, and old patterns create density in your field and quietly sabotage the flow of abundance. These hidden patterns can block money, love, health, and opportunities from showing up fully in your life.

Abundance isn’t something outside of you to chase; it’s your natural state of being! When we release the weight of what no longer serves, we open the channels for manifestation, clarity, and flow.

What to expect in this session:
- An introduction to the principles of energy healing and how it can shift your experience.
- A simple explanation of how energetic “junk” blocks abundance in everyday life.
- Insights on limiting beliefs and subconscious patterns that quietly drain your power.
- Introduction to my guided energy clearing process which you’ll experience live to release blocks and open space for more abundance to flow.

This session is designed as a gentle yet powerful introduction to the process....and a way for you to move forward focusing on shifting energy for your own empowerment. If the group enjoys it, there may be opportunities to go deeper together in future sessions.

No prior experience with energy work is needed; just an open heart and a willingness to explore. You’ll leave feeling lighter, clearer, and more connected to your natural abundance.

IMPORTANT HOUSEKEEPING- Please read:
Zoom registration is REQUIRED to attend, same as with all our zoom meetups. We start promptly at 7:05 and the zoom room will be locked, so unfortunately if you arrive late, you will not be admitted to the meetup, however the recording will be available to all who rsvp so if you miss it you can learn about the technique and get an overview afterward. The live walk-through of the clearing process itself will not be recorded, so if you wish to do some actual energy clearing you will need to be present during the meetup.
