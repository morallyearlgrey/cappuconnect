We are happy to invite you back to CRS in person for an afternoon of meditation, healing, and spiritual community! Let’s witness the light in one another and share stillness and peace of mind. We’ll begin with a short talk and guided meditation by Yasuko and then share our one-on-one spiritual healing with you. After we can enjoy some social time together.

Suggested Donation $20 cash. No one turned away due to lack of funds.
RSVP REQUIRED to [etsuko@crsny.org](http://mailto:etsuko@crsny.org/)

Bring any issue you are facing right now — physically, emotionally, mentally, and/or spiritually. With eyes closed (you will be seated and a healer will stand nearby; no touching is involved), a CRS healer, trained in A Course in Miracles and spiritual reading/healing, will observe you with inner sight, free of any judgments, a perfect shining spirit. Together, we will ask the Holy Spirit (or Inner Guide if you prefer) to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and ask for guidance about how your spirit really wants to make use of your present situation for its growth and sharing of love. After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive.

We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment. We’d like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing “solutions” to “problems” you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.
