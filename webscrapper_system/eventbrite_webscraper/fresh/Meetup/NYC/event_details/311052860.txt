Amplify the Essential with Tim Ottinger

The AI talk is an exploration of code readability, simplicity, and maintainability by raising the visibility of the most significant elements in a passage of code, and removing (or repositioning) any repetitive or insignificant elements of the passage. We will review some classes, functions, and tests by examining transformations to 'exalt the significant' and 'eliminate the redundant' -- this may change how you think about readability of code.
