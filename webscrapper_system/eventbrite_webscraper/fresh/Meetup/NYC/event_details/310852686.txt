A mixture of parks, industrial, and residential areas. We begin our walk in LIC ending in Astoria. Approximately 14 miles. Brisk, steady pace. Bring lunch and water. Meet at Jackson Ave and 46th Street (in front of Trader Joe’s). Take the 7, G, or E train to Court Square station, Long Island City. Meet 9:15 for a prompt 9:30 start.
