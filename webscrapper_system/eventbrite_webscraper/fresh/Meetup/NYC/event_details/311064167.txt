Join us for an epic 2-hour Mandarin Happy Hour! ️

This is YOUR chance to ditch the lectures and focus on what REALLY matters: REAL conversations with REAL people! Join us this Saturday at Langan's, by far the best spot for a pint in the Rockefeller Center area. Stop on by for a drink, improve your mandarin and make great connections.

Here is the Google Map link to the bar. We'll see you there this Saturday!

‍♀️ We're all about authentic connections and good vibes.

Here's what you can expect:

A mix of friendly faces: Get ready to chat, mingle, and laugh your way to fluency. Make new friends, expand your network, and practice your Chinese!
Zero pressure, all fun! We're here to practice, not judge. So come as you are and let your Mandarin flow. ✨
Our amazing hosts will break the ice: No need to feel shy! We'll make sure you feel welcome and get you chatting with everyone.
Best in class beer and food: Langan's is a mainstay, easily accessable, excellent drink menu and plenty of dinner/snack options!

This is your chance to:

Boost your confidence and fluency. The more you speak, the better you get!
Discover new ways to express yourself in Mandarin.
Make lasting friendships with people who share your passion for the language or in general. ❤️

P.S. We know finding time to practice can be tough. That's why we make it easy! Just show up, relax, and let the conversation flow. And feel free to share this event with your friends who love Chinese language and culture!
