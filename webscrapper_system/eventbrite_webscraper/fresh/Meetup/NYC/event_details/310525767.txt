We're testing a new location for this event. We'll gather outside the Amazon Go store on the second floor of Brookfield Place. The space is overlooking the Winter Garden and it is on the opposite side of the Hudson Eats food court. There are large circular stairs and two escalators heading up to the second floor.

Boundaries are the limits we set to define and protect our personal space, values, and well-being in relationships and interactions. They help us communicate our needs, establish respect, and maintain balance in how we give and receive from others. Healthy boundaries foster trust and understanding, while unclear or ignored boundaries can lead to conflict, stress, or emotional strain. Boundaries are not just about saying no—they are about creating a framework for healthier, more fulfilling connections. In this discussion, we’ll explore the role of boundaries in relationships, how to set and maintain them, and the challenges of navigating boundaries in different aspects of life.

How do you define boundaries, and why do you think they are important in relationships?
Can you share an example of a time when setting a boundary improved a relationship or situation?
What are some challenges you face when trying to set or maintain boundaries?
How do you recognize when someone else is setting a boundary, and how do you respond?
In what ways can unclear or ignored boundaries lead to conflict or stress?
How do you balance being compassionate with others while still respecting your own boundaries?
What role do boundaries play in maintaining your mental and emotional well-being?
How do cultural or societal expectations influence the way we set and respect boundaries?
How do you approach setting boundaries in professional or workplace environments?
How can you tell when it’s time to reevaluate or adjust your boundaries in a relationship?
What strategies or practices help you communicate your boundaries effectively to others?

These are just some of the questions we will discuss during our meetup. No preparation needed, just bring yourself and a willingness to listen and share your thoughts.

The meetup will be structured in a way to promote small group discussion so everyone has a chance to listen, be heard, and really dive into the discussion.

Due to the increased group size, we're making a few changes to how our discussions will be structured.

We'll arrange tables of 6 participants each, without a moderator. When you arrive, please gather at the front near the escalator. Once enough people are assembled, I'll escort each group of 6 to their table to begin the discussion, and continue doing this as more participants arrive.

Each table will receive a sheet containing the topic description and discussion questions. Feel free to take a photo or refer to the event page to have your own copy handy.

The official event time is from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm, but some of us stay longer, transitioning into informal conversations beyond the topic. You're welcome to join any other ongoing discussions once your initial group wraps up and members start leaving.

Please do not go directly to a table upon arrival; instead, wait at the front area by the escalator. This approach will help us manage seating smoothly and ensure everyone enjoys an organized and engaging discussion experience.
