Experience peak fall foliage from the water on this unforgettable kayaking adventure through the vibrant heart of New Jersey’s Pinelands. As the leaves turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and gold, we’ll paddle down the gentle, winding Mullica River — a peaceful stretch surrounded by towering pines and bursts of autumn color at every turn.
This 2-hour guided kayak tour offers front-row views of the seasonal change in one of the Northeast’s most beautiful and biodiverse ecosystems. Expect calm currents, stunning reflections, and the occasional glimpse of turtles, birds, and beaver lodges as we drift through a forest painted in peak fall brilliance.
Whether you're a seasoned paddler or trying kayaking for the first time, this is the perfect way to spend a crisp October day immersed in nature’s most colorful season. After the paddle, we’ll warm up with food and drinks at the iconic Picalilli Inn before heading back to NYC.
