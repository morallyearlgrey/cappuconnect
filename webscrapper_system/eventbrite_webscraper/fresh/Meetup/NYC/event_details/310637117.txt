Details

Come join us at The Uncommons on Wednesday nights!

***SPACE IS LIMITED, PLEASE ONLY RSVP IF YOU PLAN TO BE HERE***

TL;DR

Be kind.
Join our Discord. It's how we plan games beforehand, and generally have fun.
Be on time. People cluster up pretty fast and you can be without a gaming partner.
Cancel if you're not coming! We have limited seats.
Cost is $10 at the door. This is a special Meetup rate. It is your responsibility to tell the staff when you pay.
If any games are scheduled in advance, it'll be on the Discord, otherwise, you'll spend a little time negotiating when you arrive.

NEW TO THE MEETUP?
We are a social, friendly group that meets to play games. Any language or behavior that is racist, sexist, ableist, ageist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. will not tolerated. Bullying or bad-mouthing other attendees will also not be tolerated. We're not here to debate politics, and we are not a dating service. Obviously gaming can sometimes include trash talking. Just … know if your opponents are up for that! And look, we all make mistakes -- if you’ve offended someone, an apology can go a long way.

QUESTIONS

What kinds of games do you play?
Some examples: Hansa Teutonica, Concordia, Keyflower, Great Western Trail, Clank! In! Space!, Root, Scythe, Terraforming Mars. Some other popular games at our tables have been Reykholt, It's a Wonderful World, Draftosaurus.

Can we play X?
Sure! Suggest it. Make sure someone has a playable copy (you or the store), either you or someone else knows and can teach the game, and others agree to play. Games that take 4+ hours probably won’t hit the table.
