We're putting the "happy" back in "happy hour" -- without the eye-rolls of formal presentations, high-stakes pitches, or waiting to get approved. ðŸ™„

Because networking events should be fun, especially on a Friday.

Join Startup Grind on Friday, September 26th at Shades of Green near Union Square for Founder Drinks Roundtable. We'll chat and laugh and maybe even solve for AGI (or at least be convinced that we have).

Whether you're an early-stage startup, a seasoned entrepreneur, or someone passionate about innovation, the Founder Drinks Roundtable provides a relaxed and inclusive environment to foster connections and celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit.

Agenda:

5:00 PM: Happy Hour

Come and go as you please. Look for Startup Grind table signs toward the back.
