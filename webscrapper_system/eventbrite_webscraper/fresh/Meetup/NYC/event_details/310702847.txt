Summary:

Whether you’re preparing to buy your first home, upgrade, downsize, or sell an existing property, the real estate process can feel like a maze of negotiations, paperwork, and risks. This panel brings together experts in brokerage, legal, finance, and title research to illuminate the transaction from both sides of the table—ensuring that buyers and sellers alike walk away with insights that can save money, reduce stress, and protect their interests.
The discussion will center around four critical areas that often determine the success—or failure—of a deal:

Brokerage & Agency Relationship – Learn how to structure the buyer-agent and seller-agent relationship to ensure loyalty, transparency, and alignment of interests. Understand the hidden traps of representation agreements.
Transaction Security & Title Research – Discover how title searches, lien research, and due diligence can protect you from hidden risks—whether you’re a buyer ensuring clean ownership or a seller trying to deliver marketable title.
Legal Implications & Liability – Explore the legal responsibilities that both buyers and sellers carry in a deal, and the costly mistakes people make when they overlook disclosure obligations, inspection reports, or contract fine print.
Financing & Insurance – Gain clarity on how mortgages, loan approvals, and mortgage insurance work in today’s lending environment—and what pitfalls can derail a closing if you’re not prepared.

Attendees will walk away with a 360-degree understanding of the transaction process, equipped with strategies to protect their investment, avoid liability, and negotiate from a position of strength—whether they are buying or selling.
