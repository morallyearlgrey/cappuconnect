You’re Invited: Spice & Everything Nice at Ahimsa

Greetings gents. Let’s gather for an easy-breezy evening of Indian vegetarian classics and lively conversation on Sunday, October 5, at 6:00 PM at Ahimsa. Celebrated for comforting thalis, crisp dosas, street-style chaats, and Indo-Chinese favorites, Ahimsa offers plenty of vegan and gluten-aware options in a cozy setting.

You can preview their menu here:

We will be ordering from their à la carte menu, which offers lots of choices for entrées and desserts. Please note this restaurant is lacto-vegetarian (common for Indian cuisine) and offers lots of vegan options. https://www.ahimsanyc.com

As always, everyone will be paying for his own food plus tax and tip, so bring some cash with you for convenience.

The neighborhood is close to Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, East River and Korean Town, for anyone who would like to take a relaxing stroll after dinner, have a drink, or sip a cup of coffee.

Please RSVP by Saturday, October 4, so we can confirm our headcount with the restaurant. Can’t wait to veg out with all of you!
