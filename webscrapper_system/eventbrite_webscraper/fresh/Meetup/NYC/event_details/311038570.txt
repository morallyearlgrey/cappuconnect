Details

Blood on the Clocktower is a game of murder and mystery, lies and logic, deduction and deception.

A social game where each player receives either a ‘good’ or ‘evil’ token with their unique character on it. Good players share information to solve the mystery whilst evil players lie about who they are and what they know. The good team wins if they can piece together their knowledge, trust each other, and execute the demon. The evil team wins if the demon can sow distrust, evade detection, and wipe out the village.

We welcome both new & experienced players, and will provide a teach of the game before we begin for those that need it.

This is a free event, though we ask you support Zeppelin Hall by getting some food and/or drink for being kind enough to accommodate us.

Please note that RSVP list alone is not accurate, we are also collecting RSVPs from other sources.

There is a large parking lot nearby with free parking: https://g.co/kgs/pTfjEob
