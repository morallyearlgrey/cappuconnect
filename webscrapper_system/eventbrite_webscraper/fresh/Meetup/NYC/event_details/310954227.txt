If you have been afraid to talk to people because of consistent anxiety and fear, this is the event for you.
Anxiety can take many forms; maybe something as simple as thinking of all the bad things that could happen if you did talk to someone. Or you get a feeling of fear just at the thought of introducing yourself.
In this meetup we will go over why this happens and how to handle it.
Would you like to discover:

The source of your anxiety and how to get rid of it?
Where these fears and anxiety come from?
Why you donâ€™t feel the way you know you should?

It is time to see for yourself what has been holding you back and how to free yourself of the bondage of the past.
