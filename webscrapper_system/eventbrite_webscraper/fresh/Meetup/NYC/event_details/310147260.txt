(PLEASE NOTE: This is a one-time adjustment for our Sept. 21 event only. Due to an all-day tournament being held at our usual spot we are going to meet at the other side of the park where there are three tennis courts right next to the pickle-ball courts. We are meeting at 8 AM in case those three courts get crowded at 9 AM due to the tournament.)

Typically we are just beginners looking to improve our game. If you are more advanced then we should try and make sure that you are on opposing teams with any other advanced players so as to make things more even. We will typically just volley or play short casual sets and rotate people in case we don't have enough courts.

Overpeck Park has 6 tennis courts plus 2 wall courts for practice on either side. I recommend beginners show up early and warm up! If it looks like rain I will cancel this event 1-2 hours beforehand.

If you get there early please claim a court for us if possible. And when leaving, please double-check all your belongings. Though someone might possibly make an exception in your case, we are generally not responsible for holding onto anything for you that you may have left behind!
