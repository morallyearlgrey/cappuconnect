What if your existing PowerShell scripts could instantly become AI tools?
In this session, I’ll show how to extend AI agents with your own functions. Using my PSToolboxAI module, any PowerShell function can be registered as an AI-callable tool—no custom schemas or complex setup. Just write the function, drop it in a folder, and the AI can call it on demand.

We’ll cover:

How the toolbox works (inspired by Sourcegraph’s Amp).
Registering and surfacing your own PowerShell functions to AI.
Swapping entire toolsets just by flipping an environment variable.
Real demos: from simple utilities to building apps live.

Whether you’re automating ops tasks, managing data, or experimenting with AI agents, this approach bridges what you already know in PowerShell with the new world of AI orchestration.
