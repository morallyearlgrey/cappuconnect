Queer Hikers!

Rescheduling this. Hopefully we won't be rained out or roasted out.

This is a easy convenient hike very accessible from Penn Station. The trail head is an easy walk from the Millburn train station. We will follow the Hemlock Falls trail through some varied terrain. There are a few small waterfalls and then a larger one at the end. The trail can be rocky and portions will be steep so make sure you are in good shape. Expect an eight mile hike.

We will meet at the NJ Transit hub at Penn Station at 9:45 and catch the 10:11 to Millburn, NJ. The trailhead is close to the station. I suspect we will be back to Penn Station before 5:00.

Be prepared for steep inclines, rocky trails, and maybe a marshy water crossing. Wear hiking boots and bring a packed lunch and plenty of water.

Looking forward to seeing everyone.
