Self-care isn’t about doing the “right” thing. It’s about doing what you need right now.

In this workshop, we’ll cut through the vague advice and endless to-do lists and get practical about how to care for yourself in a way that actually works for you.

We’ll start with one of the most overlooked questions in wellbeing:

Do I need to replenish… or do I need to calm down?

By learning to recognize whether your system needs restoration (energy, connection, nourishment) or regulation (soothing, grounding, nervous system support), you can stop guessing and start choosing care that truly helps.

From there, we’ll explore the six dimensions of self-care and how they work together:

Physical – caring for your body’s basic needs and energy
Emotional – processing and expressing feelings safely
Cognitive – managing thoughts, attention, and mental overwhelm
Relational – building healthy boundaries and meaningful connection
Environmental – creating supportive spaces and routines
Protective – safeguarding your time, energy, and wellbeing

You’ll leave with:

A simple, adaptable framework to assess what you need in the moment
Tools for matching your self-care to your current state
A personalized starting point for building a self-care toolkit that actually fits your nervous system, your schedule, and your life

Self-care isn’t selfish. It’s how we build capacity for healing, growth, and resilience — without burning out along the way.
