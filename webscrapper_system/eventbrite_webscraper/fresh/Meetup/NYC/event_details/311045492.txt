We will be setting up a net here and play a few games. Majority of People playing are new to the sport or getting back into it after a long break so all levels are welcome!

We usually stay until 6-7 (mostly depends on the turn out) so if you’re running late or can’t make it at 2:30PM feel free to join between that time frame. However, please let one of the hosts know what time you will be coming so we can let you know if we leave early.

Please RSVP only if you’re able to attend, because spots are limited if you RSVP and can’t attend you’re able to cancel your RSVP.
If you have any questions or inquiries leave a comment or private message me and ill get back to you.

If you previously RSVPed and didn’t show or reach out to host you will be moved to the wait list and be given lower priority. People in the wait list priority is given to people attending for the first time and familiar faces and time you joined the wait list. People who RSVPed and didn’t show or reach out will have the lowest priority.
