Did you know your gut does more than digest food? It plays a powerful role in how your body handles stress, energy, mood, and focus.

Join us for this interactive session where weâ€™ll explore how the gut microbiome communicates with the brain through the HPA axisâ€”the bodyâ€™s main stress-response system.

Youâ€™ll learn:
âœ… How gut bacteria influence cortisol (your stress hormone) and inflammation
âœ… Why certain strains like Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus impact mood and resilience
âœ… The role of diet, sleep, and lifestyle in balancing your gutâ€“brain connection
âœ… Practical strategies to strengthen your microbiome and reduce stress naturally

This session is perfect for professionals, leaders, and anyone curious about how gut health fuels better mental clarity, resilience, and performance.
