Hello gamers, here is the next game night with free cookies.
My name is Israel and I will be your host and Richard will be your co host. I am planning on bringing modern Board Games like Werewords, Werewolf, Codenames, Say Anything and Telestrations to name a few. Richard will bring games as well. Feel free to bring a game or snack to share with others if you wish.

Our meeting location The Hugh is a Public Indoor Atrium so please be respectful of the space and to others.
We will play games and teach games. And If there are new people that never played before the group is friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel at home.
Outside food is allowed but since we will be using the space, it would be great if you could help add supporting revenue to the local atrium stores. So if possible please buy food and drinks.

*If its your first time finding our meetup look at the video tour link provided below. And then look for a black and white Meetup/SA sign on our table. ->Video Link

There will be a $2 suggested contribution which will go towards the cost of purchasing new games, name tags, pens & other supplies.
You may arrive and leave at anytime you please.
