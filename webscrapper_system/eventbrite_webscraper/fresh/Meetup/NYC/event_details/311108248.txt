Our peaceful movement is only getting bigger and stronger. “NO KINGS” is more than just a slogan—it’s the foundation our nation was built upon. Born in the streets, carried by millions in chants and on posters, it echoes from city blocks to rural town squares, uniting people across this country to fight dictatorship together.

The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings, and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty. Grow our movement and join us.

In New York City, people will be massing in Bryant Park on Saturday, October 18th at 12:00 noon. Here's the link to sign up (on Mobilize) but you can also just show up: https://www.mobilize.us/nokings/event/838831/

From the event page on Mobilize: A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

OVER 100 NATIONAL AND LOCAL GROUPS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO PARTNER IN ORGANIZING THIS DAY OF MASS MOBILIZATION. Check out the list of partner organizations here and also check the No Kings website.

Optional Meeting Point: You can just join the protest on your own, you don't have to march with other meetup members. But for those who want to arrive early and march together, we will meet at 11:30am in front of the Whole Foods Market at 1095 6th Avenue, between 41st & 42nd Streets, across the street from Bryant Park. We will meet in front of (outside of) the front doors to the store, and I will hold up a VEG MEETUP sign. We will wait in front of the Whole Foods for 10 minutes only, until 11:40am, and then walk across the street to Bryant Park. If you want to meet us, don't be late, and you may want to plan to be early due to large crowds and delayed travel time.
