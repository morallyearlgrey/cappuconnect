This is a great time to visit the Gardens, as the gigantic rose garden should be in full bloom for the second time this summer. There are numerous other gardens here as well as an original tract of old-growth forest plus a beautiful river, waterfall, and wetlands.

DISTANCE: About 2-3 miles.

FINISH AT: Roughly 4 PM; you can leave earlier, of course.

LUNCH: Around 1:30. Bring your own or buy something at the cafe (nothing fancy there).

TRANSPORTATION: Metro North train from Grand Central (12:42) or Harlem/125th St (12:52), both arriving at Botanical Garden station at 1:05. Then cross Southern Blvd (also called Kazamiroff Blvd) to the Garden's Mosholu gate.

Subway: D or 4 train to Bedford Park Blvd Station. Then:

Take the Bx 26 bus east to the Garden's Mosholu Gate entrance.
OR walk eight blocks down the hill on Bedford Park Blvd to the end (approximately 10 minutes). Turn left onto Southern/Kazimiroff Blvd and walk about one block to the entrance.

COST: NYC residents: $15 adults, $7 seniors and students; nonresidents $35 adults, $31 seniors and students. Buy tickets at the entrance or, for nonresidents only, online. Plus $5 for metro north (ask for City Ticket) each way to and from Grand Central or Harlem.
Plus $1 for me to help cover Meetup's annual $390 organizer fee.
