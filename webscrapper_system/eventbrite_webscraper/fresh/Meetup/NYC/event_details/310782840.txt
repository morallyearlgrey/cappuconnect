Meditate NYC has become a cherished annual tradition—an oasis of calm in the heart of the city. This year’s theme, ***“Meditate Now for a Peaceful World,”***reflects the 2025 International Day of Peace theme: “Act Now for a Peaceful World.” It invites us to respond to the challenges of our time with clarity, compassion, and courageous stillness. As the world calls for peace, we begin with the breath—grounding ourselves in presence to nurture peace within and around us.

Join us for an afternoon of guided meditation and reflection led by respected Buddhist teachers from a wide range of traditions. Whether you are new to meditation or a longtime practitioner, this gathering offers a rare opportunity to experience the richness of Buddhist wisdom and the power of collective practice.

This event is free and open to all—offering accessible, welcoming space for anyone seeking peace, healing, and deeper connection.

Come meditate with us—and help create a more peaceful world, one breath at a time.

Temple/Center Participants: You are encouraged to bring your own brochures and promotional materials to contribute to the Sangha tables.
