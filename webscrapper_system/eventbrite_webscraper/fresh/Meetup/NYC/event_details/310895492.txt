Step into the world of Vibecoding — where coding meets creativity, and technology meets mood. In this workshop, we’ll explore how to use AI tools to create playful, expressive outputs that capture emotions, aesthetics, and vibes. Instead of focusing on technical perfection, we’ll focus on feeling, experimentation, and flow.
Participants will learn how to craft prompts, remix ideas, and use AI as a co-creator — whether that means designing generative text, playful chatbots, or interactive mood-based experiences. No coding background is required — just curiosity and creativity.
