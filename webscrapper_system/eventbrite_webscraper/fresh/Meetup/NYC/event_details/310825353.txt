Come hike one of the nicest loops in SE PA - the Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. Hike is about 9 miles long with 1000 feet elevation gain. Great views at both the Pulpit Rock and at the extensive rock outcrops at the Pinnacle. This should be peak leaf season, so it's important to get a relatively early start. I am in PA, so you will have to arrange transportation and carpooling from NYC on your own.
