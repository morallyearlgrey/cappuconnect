Hi neighbors! Let's gather together, share ideas, and talk tech.

Since a lot of us are in permanent WFH mode, we thought it would be nice to have a reason to leave our apartments in the morning and interact with real live friendly faces in our neighborhood.

This is a host-free event with no specific agenda. Let’s meet up and chat in the morning:

What are you working on?
What tech are you learning?
What tech questions do you have?
Would you like some accountability to help you push ahead?
… and more!

Be sure to be respectful of our gathering place: purchase a coffee, tip your baristas, keep the place clean, etc.

Looking forward to seeing you!!
