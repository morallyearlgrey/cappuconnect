Are you currently encountering challenges and in need of guidance from your spiritual support team? Do you have a situation in your life that needs attention, but you're uncertain about the next steps? If you're feeling adrift and could use assistance from your Angels and guides, I warmly invite you to join me on Monday, June 30th, from 6:30-7:30pm EST on Zoom for an intimate gathering of just ten participants. Those who are on the waitlist will be granted access during the event if there are any no-shows.
During this session, I will channel messages from your guides and Angels who are eager to assist you in moving forward and providing the support you need. This gathering is free of charge and spots are limited, so please keep that in mind. Come prepared with any questions for your spiritual support team, and let me help you gain clarity in your challenges. Remember, you donâ€™t have to navigate this journey alone; your Spiritual support team is here to guide you.
