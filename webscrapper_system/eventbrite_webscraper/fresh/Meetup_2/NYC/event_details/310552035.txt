Join the Jersey City Lunch Club and make new friends!
Each meetup brings together 4–6 people for casual conversations over lunch. We use the Groupvibe platform to facilitate the meetup and ensure everyone’s a good fit.

👉 To attend, you’ll need to complete registration via this link:
https://web.groupvibe.com/club?mode=lunch
We’ll share the exact location of the upcoming meetup the night before only if you have bought a ticket or membership plan.

Why this works:
* Smaller groups make real conversations easier.
* Discover new restaurants in your city, together.
* Curated lunch venues with good food and vibe.
* If you hit it off with your group, there’s plenty of time to hang out afterwards.
Note:
RSVPs on Meetup don’t reflect total attendance. Many attendees register directly via our website. The event on Meetup.com is only a placeholder.

This meetup is organized by Groupvibe, a small team passionate about helping people form meaningful friendships offline.
