In "Bird and Friends - Cosmic Unity," (aka Cosmic Improv) veteran improviser Michael Bird creates an improv show with the audience, where anyone watching can jump into his set at anytime. That means if YOU are currently reading this, you could jump into Bird's show, creating the ultimate cosmic unity of PLAY!

Joining Bird to kick-off the night, we've got three stellar improv acts from the NYC indy scene, ended by Cosmic Improv where anyone can jump in at anytime.

Let's create some improvised cosmic unity ya'll.

NOTE: While the show itself is Free, the venue does request a one-drink minimum (a $3 club soda counts) to support the bar and keep this creative space alive.
