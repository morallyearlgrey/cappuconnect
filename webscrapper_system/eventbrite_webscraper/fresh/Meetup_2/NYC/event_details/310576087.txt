Prado Museum - Madrid, Span: A Collection of Wonders Film Screening!

Let’s travel to one of my favorite places, Madrid, Spain, to see one of the world’s greatest art museums, the Prado. Our online/virtual adventure will feature a very brief overview of the museum followed by a full screening of the documentary film “The Prado Museum: A Collection of Wonders” hosted by Jeremy Irons (preview link below).

The Prado Museum (/ˈprɑːdoʊ/ PRAH-doh; Spanish: Museo del Prado), officially known as Museo Nacional del Prado, is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It is widely considered to house one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish royal collection, and the single best collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. The Prado Museum is one of the most visited sites in the world and is considered one of the greatest art museums in the world. The numerous works by Francisco Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Hieronymus Bosch, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, and Diego Velázquez, are some of the highlights of the collection. Velázquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now one of the largest outside Italy.

The collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to many other works of art and historic documents. The Prado is one of the most-visited art museums in the world and is one of the largest museums in Spain.

The Prado, with the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía, forms Madrid's Golden Triangle of Art, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2021.
