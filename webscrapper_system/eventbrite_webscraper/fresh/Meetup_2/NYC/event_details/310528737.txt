Why this group?
We are increasingly delegating short writing tasks to AI. But for executives, professionals, and academics dealing with complex ideas, this is often counterproductive. Good writing and good thinking go hand in hand—if you cannot express your proposal with simplicity and grace in your own words, you probably do not yet fully understand it.
Why it matters for your career
The importance of powerful writing and speaking can hardly be overstated. In a world where many struggle to communicate clearly, your ability to write and speak with clarity and style will set you apart—and help you move forward.

What we’ll do
We’ll start by sharing and exploring common challenges in communication. Then we’ll examine a short sample of writing, discuss how it might be improved, and draw out key principles for clear, persuasive, and stylish communication.

Bring your own work (optional)
If you’d like feedback, feel free to bring a sample of your writing (up to 300 words). I’ll review as many as possible during the session.
Looking forward to meeting you and building a space where international professionals can practice and grow together.
