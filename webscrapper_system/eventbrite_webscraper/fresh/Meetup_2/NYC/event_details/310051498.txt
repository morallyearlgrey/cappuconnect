Running can be overwhelming and a bit daunting if you are just starting out. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created the Central Park Beginner Runners Club, a relaxed, no pressure group for anyone looking to ease into running, enjoy the outdoors, and meet friendly faces along the way. Whether you‚Äôve never run a mile or are just getting back into it, we‚Äôll take it slow together with an easy 3 mile jog on Sunday mornings.

If you need to take a breather and walk, please feel free to let me know and we can slow down. All i ask is that you try your best! However, there is no pressure as this is a beginner friendly group!

If you're interested in running together, feel free to join us anytime! We'll gather every Sunday morning at the Gapstow bridge. You can expect the pace to be anywhere between 10-13min mile pace.

Our usual route will start from the Gapstow bridge then we will run up north to the reservoir and do a lap around. That should be about 3 miles. Depending on how people feel, we may jog back to the original meetup spot or we can walk back. üôÉ

We'll meet at 10:00 AM and aim to finish by 11:00 AM at the latest. Please bring the bare minimum as it may be difficult to find a place to store your stuff!

Whether you're a beginner runner, looking to lose weight, or just want to run, everyone is welcome!
