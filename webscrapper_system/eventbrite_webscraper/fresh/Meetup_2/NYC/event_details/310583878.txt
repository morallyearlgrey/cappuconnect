Beyond Personas: Designing with Jobs-to-be-Done in Mind with Michele Oliver, Ph.D.

Tuesday, September 23rd at 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM ET.
This is an online event.

Tired of vague personas and guesswork? The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework offers a powerful lens for understanding what truly drives user behavior. In this session, we'll break down how JTBD helps uncover the real motivations behind choices, align cross-functional teams around customer needs, and prioritize product decisions that solve the right problems.

Whether you're a UX professional, product leader, or researcher, you'll leave with practical strategies to put JTBD into action, grounded in real examples and ready for immediate use.
