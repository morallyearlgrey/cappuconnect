We now hold combined in-person / online meetings. Our in-person venue is Minneapolis Central Library, 300 Nicollet Mall, usually in room S-275, but we'll let you know when we need to use a different room. After you RSVP, please let Jamie Richter or Paul Lubinski know if you'll attend in-person or online. If the latter, please tell us where the Zoom link can be sent. (Please note that we cannot send the meeting agenda or other files via Meetup; we'll need an email address to do that.)
Whether you work in or near downtown Minneapolis, reside in the area, or pass through along your way, see how our practice of prepared speaking, impromptu speaking, evaluations, and related leadership skills can apply to your personal and professional goals.
