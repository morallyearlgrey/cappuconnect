General: We will discuss Stoic Philosophy in general, I will present a few Stoic practices that can be directly employed in your life in order to reach a little more equanimity in this crazy world and discuss specific reading that are encouraged but not necessarily required to be read.

This weekly MeetUp of the MKE Stoic Fellowship is being organized by MKE Stoic Fellowship member, and Graduate of the College of Stoic Philosophers - School of Essential Studies, Dan Hayes.

We are meeting on the internet. I will post a hangouts link in the messages of this meetup just before the meeting for you all to join.

As with all of our events, all are welcome!
