Only heavy rain can stop us!

Dear citizens of Neverwinter, it's time for a new hike! Let's do Anthony's Nose to trail Fort Hill Park trails.
As always we will pass through lakes, rivers around the Hudson.
We will have lunch by the peak of the mountain and enjoy the gorgeous view on the river and a bridge and come back to NY from Peekskill.
If we have enough time we will have dinner together.
This is not a loop walk!
