(First 5 ladies save $5 by using discount code LADIES at checkout. Multiple groups are co-organizing. Space is limited and this event sells out every time.)

(*Ignore any references if you RSVP and it says you can pay organizer directly. This is a Meetup glitch they hopefully fix. The only way to attend is to get ticket in advance at link at top of event description.)

Take in the beautiful views of the High Line & Hudson Yards while meeting fun & friendly singles! Get some fresh air, some exercise, and meet some new peopleâ€¦ and maybe even that special someone! Plus, enjoy the views, unique architecture & cutting-edge art that is all a part of the High Line.

These "Date Walks" are a very casual and non-awkward way to meet others. Our host will be there to make introductions and every 10 minutes or so, will also ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken to yet so everyone gets a chance to talk with everyone.

We'll walk a 1.5-2 mile stretch of the High Line. We will then hang afterwards at a nearby fun venue for food and drinks.

FAQs:
How many will attend? We are limiting the # of attendees to 30 so that there is enough time to meet and spend time with everyone. And we do our best to keep the gender ratio as even as possible.

What are the ages? We'll have a good mix of ages and everyone usually finds others in their age group.

What if rains? We will email attendees a new date.

Can I come alone? Yes, about 90% come on their own.

How much? $15-$25 depending upon when you get ticket and spots left.
