Welcome to our Grab a Byte lunch series! This month's topic is about the Python package manager uv.

uv can set you free of your environment and dependency issues in python. Setting virtual environments, managing package dependencies and installing/ loading them across systems was never this easier.

For R lovers stuck with figuring python code, think of a version of combination of pak::pak() , here::here() and more.

Join us every month, typically we meet the third Friday of the month at noon. We take turns sharing something Python-related and of interest to our community. We're always looking for presenters! So if you have a cool project or tool you have been using, please let us know.
