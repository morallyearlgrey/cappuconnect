This is a free meeting.

In this meeting, you will learn how to let go of the past, such as divorce, breakup, pain, abuse, and other trauma.

A failed relationship often can affect a person's mental state in a very negative way, including

Less self-confidence
Less motivation
Anger
Depression
Loss of trust

I'm sure you know that an angry and depressed person who is low on self-confidence and motivation is not going to be happy in life, and neither is this person likely to find a good future partner; therefore, let's learn to how to fully recover from the past.

We will discuss an effective tool for getting over painful experiences in this meeting. Come and find out!

This meetup event is brought to you by the Dianetics and Scientology life improvement information center in Washington, DC.
