September 21 - We are reading NE VII.7, which is about two variants of lacking self-control: being endurant-steadfast {karteria} and being soft-pampered {malakia}. Why does Aristotle say that these are forms of lacking self-control {akrasia}? The first sounds pretty good, right? Let's follow his train of thought.
.
We will read the 8 translations starting at 1150a9.

My summary of chapter 6 on lacking self-control with respect to emotion can be found here to help you catch up to us. https://mega.nz/file/OzYXXCZI#K6p6FHf2ohSrZ5NrMrr-H90w_TLYFng-kYpO4KmcHok Bring your own questions about the text if you are interested in joining this Sunday's meeting.

We are live-reading and discussing Aristotle's ~Nicomachean Ethics~, book VII, which is about troubleshooting the virtues of character. We use mainly the English translation by Adam Beresford (Penguin Classics, 2020).
.
The prerequisite to this book is our answering for ourselves these questions from the prior books, to which we will briefly review:
.
1. What is a virtue of character {ēthikē aretē}?
2. How does one come to acquire it? (E.g. [Aristotle’s], ambition, bravery, gentlemanliness, generosity, candor, balanced-temper, …)
3. From a first-person perspective in being virtuous, how does one feel and what does one see (differently, discursively) in a given situation of everyday living?
4. From a third-person perspective, how is the virtuous person (of a specific virtue) to be characterized?
