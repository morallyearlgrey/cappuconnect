Ignore any references to when you RSVP you can pay organizer directly. This is a Meetup glitch that they hopefully fix. This is a prepay event and only way to attend is to get ticket in advance at link above).

**Our events are co-organized by multiple groups so don't pay attention to the RSVPs. Our events are consistently well attended. Members just get tickets and don't RSVP.

Join us for a Singles Stroll in Central Park! Our date walks are becoming an extremely popular way to meet singles in a scenic setting.

This event very casual and non-awkward + our host will help to make introductions. Every 10 minutes or so our host will also ask the men to switch with a woman they have not spoken to yet so everyone gets a chance to talk with everyone.

We'll walk a 1.5-2 mile stretch through Central Park. We'll then end the walk watching the sunset together. Feel free to exchange contact info with others after walk.

FAQs:
Where to meet? Exact meeting location with host contact info will be sent to all paid attendees day of the event.

How many will attend? We are limiting the # of attendees to a max of 25 so that everyone will get to spend a good amount of time getting to know each other.

What are the ages? We'll have a good mix of ages of 20s, 30s, 40s

What if rains? We will email attendees a new date.

Can I come alone? Yes, about 90% come on their own.
