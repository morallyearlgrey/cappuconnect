Our next Meetup, on the fourth Sunday of the month, will be online. We're still considering the possibility of meeting in person again at an upcoming meeting, with a Zoom connection available at the same time for those who are farther away so they could join us online.

The topic for Sunday, September 28 will be: "The Current State of Democracy in the U.S." With armed US troops on the streets and the suppression of basic constitutional norms and the declaration of Emergency executive powers, is this what the first American Coup d'etat looks like? Now where do we go from here? Stuart Hirsch will introduce the topic, followed by open discussion.

We welcome a diversity of views, for open-minded discussion, where we can learn from each other.

We meet the 4th Sunday of each month, 12:30-2:00, and are currently meeting online. At about 12:45, the speaker that day introduces the topic (usually a 20 minute introduction), followed by open discussion.

We were meeting in a restaurant before the covid situation. When we met there, our format was: lunch and socializing, the first hour; then a presentation, followed by open discussions. The topics are on various subjects related to human values, such as: aspects of society; the arts; social science; current events; nature and evolution; history; science and technology; ethics; philosophy, etc.
