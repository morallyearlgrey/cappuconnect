Details

This Museum is so accommodating and relaxing that it's a perennial favorite of mine to sketch in. But it's been almost two years since we've been here as a group. Current exhibitions include "Art from the Martin Wong Graffiti Collection" (shown here), "New York at its Core", and more. The museum is at 1220 Fifth Ave, at 103rd Street.

IMPORTANT: Purchase your ticket from me, not the museum! I'll be waiting at the entrance. I accept cash or Venmo. Tickets are only $5.

Any problems on the day of the event, I can be reached at 646-831-9816.

Looking forward to sketching with you!

What makes our Meetups different from other art groups and classes? There's no instruction, but we like to share our work, and chat and be inspired. Share tips and learn from people in a casual environment where all levels of artists are welcome! Don't be shy to ask anyone anything!

• We sketch for a bit, usually 45 minutes or so, and then get back together and share our drawings, and then sketch again, etc. There's usually time for 3 sketches.

• Please bring your own supplies - anything you like to work with - pens, pencil, watercolor, pastel, small sketchbook or large paper, iPad, whatever suits you.

• We hand out nametags so everyone can meet one another!

• We take photos to share on the site later. Take a bunch!

• Sorry, but please leave the dogs at home; they tend to step on the artwork. Thanks.

• Everyone at all skill levels is welcome!
