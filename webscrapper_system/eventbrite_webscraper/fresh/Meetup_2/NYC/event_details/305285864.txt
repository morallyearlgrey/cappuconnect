Plan ahead - Mark this date on your calendar and book your trip to NYC!
If you've been a part of NYC Scrum User Group in the past - as a speaker, an organiser, or a participant, we'd like to see you at the group's 16th birthday! If you haven't been to our meetups before - this is the perfect time to join this vibrant community of agilists.

Join us in person to celebrate the group's birthday, re-connect with the community, reflect on the group's journey, and win a prize or two in our birthday raffle!
See you there.
