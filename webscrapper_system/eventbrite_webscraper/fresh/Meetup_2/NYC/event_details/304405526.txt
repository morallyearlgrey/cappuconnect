Details

This is our monthly meeting. We'll discuss activities for the previous month, and we'll plan for the next month. People of all technical skill levels are welcome.

Thanks to Lynq Systems, we'll be meeting at the WeWork at 700 Seventh Avenue, in midtown Manhattan. The meeting is from 5:30 to 7:30; please try to arrive before 6, as access becomes more difficult after that. We generally continue with a no-host dinner after the meeting somewhere in the neighborhood.

We'll have a Zoom option. Please send email to Terry Moore (search for "contact" on our website, thethings.nyc) to register for the Zoom meeting, or check things-nyc.slack.com for the link.

Best regards,
--Terry
