Inside each of us is a system of parts, inner voices, strategies, and roles we’ve developed to survive, belong, and protect ourselves.

This workshop introduces Internal Family Systems (IFS) as a gentle, structured way to understand those parts and relate to them with curiosity instead of judgment.

If you’ve ever felt like one part of you feels like a little child when you're trying to do adult responsibilities, you've probably felt one of your inner parts. Or if you’ve heard your inner critic, the anxious planner, the people-pleaser, this work will help you understand why they’re there and what they need.

You’ll also learn how younger parts, the ones shaped by early experiences of fear, abandonment, or pressure, still carry unprocessed emotions and unmet needs. Reconnect to your parts with compassion and care, so they no longer have to drive your life from the shadows.

You’ll explore:

The key types of parts (protectors, exiles, managers) and how to recognize them
How parts form in response to trauma, stress, or early attachment wounds
How to begin building a relationship with your parts without being overwhelmed
Establishing safe spaces within you for your parts

This is foundational work for trauma healing and central to the “Emotional Reconnection” and “Self-Awareness” phases of my Integration Path™ for recovering from trauma.

You’ll leave with a clear entry point into parts work and a deepened capacity for self-compassion.
