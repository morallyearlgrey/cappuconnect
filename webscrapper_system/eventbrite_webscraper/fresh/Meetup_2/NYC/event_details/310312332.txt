A searing exploration of authoritarianism in the Middle East through the legacy of Gamal Abdel Nasser’s years in power in Cold War–era Egypt. We Are Your Soldiers examines seven countries—Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen, and Libya—and Nasser’s impact on each of them.

The larger-than-life Egyptian president ruled for eighteen years between the coup d’état he led in 1952 and his death in 1970, during which he wrested control of the Suez Canal from the British and French empires.

We Are Your Soldiers: How Gamal Abdel Nasser Remade the Arab World by Alex Rowell is available in all formats at public libraries and bookstores. 370 pp
