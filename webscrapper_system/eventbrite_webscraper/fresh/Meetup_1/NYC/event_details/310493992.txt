THIS IS A FREE MEETUP EVENT ON ZOOM.

Irrational Emotions do not not come from your good experiences.
They come from your painful experiences. Some common examples include breakups, abuse, stressful relationships, losing someone, losing status, etc.

People often feel different, less trusting and less self esteem after such incidents.

Unfortunately, these painful memories can continue to affect a person's happiness, often for life.

Find out why your past is preventing future happiness and fulfillment.
Learn about an amazing technique that can release those past painful emotions.

In this meeting, we'll talk about an effective tool to FULLY get over the painful experiences, so that you can be free of the mental and emotional impacts from them.

After this meeting, if you need more help, you can also consult with a counselor at no charge.

This group is created by the Dianetics & Scientology life improvement information center in Washington, DC.
