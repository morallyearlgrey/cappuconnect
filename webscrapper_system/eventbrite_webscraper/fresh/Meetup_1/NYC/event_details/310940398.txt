Candlestick patterns are the foundation of price action. Which they reveal the story behind every move in the market.
In this one-hour live workshop, you’ll learn how to break down individual candlesticks (body, wick, range, open/close) and interpret what each one tells you about momentum, indecision, or potential reversal.
We’ll then dive into key multi-candle formations like:
– Engulfing candles (momentum shift)
– Pin bars / Hammers (rejection and reversal zones)
– Doji candles (market indecision)
– Inside bars (consolidation and breakout setups)
– ETC.
You’ll learn how to read these patterns in context, not just memorise shapes, so you can recognise real opportunities and avoid common traps.
Perfect for beginners or anyone who wants a clearer understanding of candlesticks and how to use them in live market conditions.
