Having an in-person meeting at Gran Merci. The entrance is the southwest corner of 24th and 3rd.

We are one of few Toastmasters clubs in NYC offering in-person meetings and we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity for in-person communication and networking.

Interested in improving your public speaking skills?

Want to meet new people and engage in interesting discussions?

Hoping to make new business and life connections?

If so we welcome you to attend the next Greenspeakers meeting. Greenspeakers is a Toastmasters club that was founded by Green Party members to provide a forum for engaged progressive activists and professionals to improve their public speaking skills. Guests of all political persuasions are welcome and we have no official connection to any political party.

All attendees will have a chance to practice public speaking and will learn helpful tricks to become a more confident public speaker and communicator.

Hope to see you there!
