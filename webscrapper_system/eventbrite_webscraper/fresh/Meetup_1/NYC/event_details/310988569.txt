### Founders: Raised, Raising, and Ready – Mixer (NYC)

Come be part of an evening built exclusively for tech founders — whether you’ve already secured funding, are actively raising, or preparing for that first round. This isn’t about pitches or panels; it’s a true founder-to-founder gathering where conversations flow, insights are exchanged, and opportunities emerge when ambitious minds connect.
Look forward to genuine discussions, fresh perspectives, and the chance to meet founders who’ve been through it — ready to share hard-won lessons, make warm intros, and spark collaborations that help you move faster.
We’re not new to this. With the Global Development Consortium, we’ve hosted over 14 events in NYC in a single month, uniting more than 1,000 founders and investors. After a year-long pause, we’re returning — with even stronger energy, sharper focus, and a deeper community.
Join us for a night of ideas, momentum, and possibility — the kind of energy that can open doors to capital, partnerships, and the breakthroughs you’ve been looking for.
