Join me and my colleagues, Vern Schellenger and Alki Thompson, for Hire Moment Mastermind, an open Q&A on your most pressing job search questions!

SCHEDULING CHANGE AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2024:
We will now be meeting biweekly - every other Friday - and have a new Zoom link that will be active until March 28, 2025.

Can't make it? No problem! I'll be recording the session and posting it on purposefulhire.com/hire-moment-mastermind/

Look forward to seeing you on Zoom!
