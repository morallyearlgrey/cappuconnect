*GET TICKETS AT - https://dljparty.ticketleap.com/sunset-yacht-party/dates (*Ignore any references if you RSVP and it says you can pay organizer directly. This is a Meetup glitch that they hopefully fix. This is a prepay event and only way to attend is to get ticket in advance at link above).

**Our events are co-organized by multiple groups so don't pay attention to the RSVPs. Our events are consistently well attended. Members get tickets and don't RSVP.
