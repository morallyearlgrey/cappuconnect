We had a great outcome last meetup! The address is right next to Penn Station 134 West 29th Street 2nd floor
We will be going over stocks, options, forex and futures as well as a touch of crypto. We have trading experts with financial industry experience that will help explain the charts that we are analyzing.

Itâ€™s really worth it if you can come in person.

This is also a zoom event however we hope to see you in person!
