CIBN Connect is proud to be offering more than 10 online business networking events per week. Each of these events have unique formats and content to help business owners learn new skills and optimize their business.

Format
Be prepared to share a 1 minute infomercial about who you are, what you do, and what type of connections youâ€™re looking for.

After introductions, it is our goal to have you speak as much as possible in the meeting, so that youâ€™re more likely to make connections and book appointments. Weâ€™ll typically have conversations about what type of networking weâ€™re doing, and what types of connections we have. This makes it easier to generate referrals/connections after the meeting.

And hopefully you donâ€™t mind, but personally I canâ€™t stand boring presentations, so you will never see one of those here.
