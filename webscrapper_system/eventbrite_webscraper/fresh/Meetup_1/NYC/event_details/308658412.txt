Is there anything you've been wanting to do for a while, but you keep putting it off to tend to obligations, or urgent matters? This event provides a space where we can provide each other with support and soft accountability as we work towards our goals. We use the term "dream" very loosely here... it could really mean anything, including exercise, a hobby, cleaning a room, etc.

Schedule:

7:00 pm - Check-in 1: What will you be working on today?
7:05-7:10 pm - Dream Hour Part 1: 50-55 minutes to work on your dreams!
8:00 pm - Check-In 2: What progress have you made?
8:05-8:10 pm - Dream Hour Part 2: 50-55 more minutes of working time.
9:00 pm - Check-out

Here's a quick intro to "body doubling": https://youtu.be/ni9biXNDZe0

Notes:

If you are new to the group, welcome! To help foster a sense of safety and community, any newbies must be willing to unmute themselves and check-in at least twice during their first visit. Also, everyone (old and new!) must be willing to show their face on camera IF asked to do so by the host.
I may end a session early if no one has joined the room within the first hour.
