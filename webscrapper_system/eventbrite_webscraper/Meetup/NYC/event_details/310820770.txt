Come to network, chat, talk shop, or just hang out with like-minded WordPress folks.

I've reserved a private room at Handcraft NYC just for our group. Complimentary appetizers will be provided, and additional food and beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) can be purchased separately. If you have any food allergies, please let us know beforehand.
I hope to see you there!

Date: Tuesday, September 30th
Venue: Roylene & Grace (a speakeasy located in the back of Handcraft NYC)
