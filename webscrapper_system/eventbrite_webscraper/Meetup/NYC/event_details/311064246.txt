In today’s divided climate, political conversations can often feel tense, unproductive, or even unsafe. Yet open dialogue across differences is essential for a healthy democracy and thriving communities. This event will explore the role of safety in political discussions—what it means, why it matters, and how it can be created.

Together, we’ll ask:

What does “safety” mean in the context of political dialogue?
Can true understanding happen without it?
How do we balance honesty and respect while discussing deeply held beliefs?
What tools or practices can communities use to make political discussions safer and more constructive?

This will be an interactive conversation, not a debate. Our goal is to listen, learn, and reflect on how we can build environments where people feel secure enough to share openly—and courageous enough to hear perspectives that challenge their own.

Join us as we practice listening to understand and explore how safety might be the key to deeper connection and more meaningful political dialogue.

Blake McBride:
Blake McBride is a software engineer, author, and business owner with a keen interest in philosophy and politics. As a lifelong non-religious Republican and a deep thinker, Blake recognizes the limitations of his knowledge and remains open to the possibility of being wrong.

Throughout his forty years as an adult, he has encountered few individuals willing to engage in constructive discussions about politics. In recent times, the typical response has often been limited to ad hominem attacks, with little willingness to address the underlying issues. Blake eagerly anticipates the opportunity to share his perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of opposing viewpoints.
