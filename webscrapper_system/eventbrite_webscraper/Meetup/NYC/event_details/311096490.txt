If you have too much negative emotions, they can severely impact your social life. For instance, if you feel depressed, you will not feel like participating and meeting with people.

Emotions such as anger, fear, stress, anxiety, or depression can affect how you deal with and talk with people, and, as a result, your relationships with others can suffer.

In order to improve your social life and make more friends, it starts with yourself: You need to heal your own mind!

Confucius said, “The perfecting of one's self is the fundamental base of all progress and all moral development.”

Indeed, by fixing yourself first, you will fix the rest of your life, including your social life.

Come to this free meeting and learn how to get rid of your negative emotions and FEEL ALIVE!

This group is brought to you by the Dianetics & Scientology life improvement center.
