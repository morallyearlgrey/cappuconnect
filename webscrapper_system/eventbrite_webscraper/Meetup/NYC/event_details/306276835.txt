UPDATE: We decided to make our social hangout local. RSVP on Bunch for the location: https://www.letsbunch.com/id_32

RSVP on the Bunch app is required - [LetsBunch.com](https://www.letsbunch.com)

For new peeps here, we're a JC group that puts on free events and is welcoming to everyone! We believe in making society more open, but in a secure way - that's why we started a free hangout app Jan'25 where we can easily communicate and keep track of real accounts. You can also create hangouts around your schedule and invite our entire network! Stuff like "Meet new locals over coffee", "Let's work togehter", "Let's go for a walk" ... anyone can create these on Bunch - [LetsBunch.com](https://www.letsbunch.com)
