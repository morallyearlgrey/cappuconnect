Join us for a special Group Speed Dating Night at Skino’s NYC — curated for ambitious professionals in STEM, Finance, and beyond. Whether you’re crunching numbers, solving equations, or running projects, this is your chance to connect with like-minded singles who actually get your lifestyle.

📍 Venue: Skino’s, NYC
📅 Date: Tuesday, October 15, 2025
⏰ Time: 6:30 PM – 9:00 PM (check-in opens at 6:00 PM)

💡 How It Works
• Group Rounds: Instead of 1:1 speed dating, you’ll rotate in groups of 3–4 singles — keeping things fun, relaxed, and social.
• 10-Minute Conversations: Just enough time to spark a vibe before moving on.
• Send Likes in Real Time: Through our MeetNVibe system, you can say “yay or nay” during each round. Mutual likes get shared after the event.
• Bring a Friend or Come Solo: Both ways are welcome — you’ll fit right in.

🎟️ Tickets
• Early Bird: $15

Limited spots available — we keep groups small and connections genuine.
