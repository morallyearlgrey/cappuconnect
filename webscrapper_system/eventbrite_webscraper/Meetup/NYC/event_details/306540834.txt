Philadelphia Death Café, held on the second and the last Monday of each month, is online.

The Death Café phenomenon started in Europe as an open and supportive forum for people to discuss mortality, free of taboo and social stigma, over coffee and snacks. And since we're online, you can enjoy those snacks in the comfort of your home.

Please join us for a friendly, respectful conversation about life and death from any angle that interests you. Our inquisitiveness has led to many fascinating discussions. Openness is the only prerequisite.
