Come to chat, network, and learn about bitcoin!

Everyone is encouraged to attend, anywhere from skeptic to cypherpunk to just a little Bitcoin curious, we're all about getting in the weeds and answering questions of all kinds while having some drinks and meeting cool peeps.

If you use Bitcoin or have questions or are interested in learning more, we'd love to see you there!
Setting up a cadence for the second Thursday of the month, will also try to sprinkle in more meetings throughout.
Free Parking is available in the large Zeppelin Hall parking lot, and the location is walking distance from the path and light rail. https://goo.gl/maps/1yYnBTMzfiSpjsEB9
