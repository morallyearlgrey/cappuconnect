Join us for the last (and liveliest!) day of the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy (Manhattan). 🎉 Expect iconic Italian street food, live music, colorful vendors, and the joy of sharing it all with good company.

Things to Look Forward To:

Legendary street food: sausage & peppers, zeppoles, cannolis, fried calamari and more
Live music & sometimes street performances up and down Mulberry Street
Local vendors with art, jewelry, sweets
Restaurants lined up on each side of the streets
Ferris wheel
Good company — entrepreneurs, artists, foodies, anyone who loves the vibe

Meeting time: By 1:30 PM the festival is in full swing but not yet overwhelmingly crowded, so we can enjoy more, move around easier, try more food, and get a great spot for photos without waiting forever.

📲 Stay Connected on WhatsApp:
Because the festival gets crowded, I believe it’s important we connect on WhatsApp in case anyone gets separated from the group. Once you RSVP, you’ll get the link to join our chat so we can easily find each other during the day.

This event is rain or shine (yes, I’ve been before in the rain, and it’s still fun!). Whether 5 people join or 20, we’ll make it a memorable afternoon.

💵 Contribution: $5 per person. (Early bird $3 ends Monday 9/15). This is non-refundable and helps offset the monthly cost I’m charged by Meetup to run this group, plus other organizing considerations.

📍 Meetup Spot: St. Patrick's Old Cathedra at Mulberry & Prince Streets — the church complex tkes up teh entire block. Look for me with a big smile!

👟 Pro Tips:

Wear comfortable shoes — we’ll be walking and eating!
Bring small bills (some vendors are cash-only).
Come hungry and ready to laugh, eat, and celebrate!
