NOTE: Start time: 7:00 pm.

As usual, please bring a Question for submission for possible discussion. Please frame the question in a simple interrogative statement.

If/when circumstances permit, we usually discuss two questions.

We follow the Christopher Phillips format:
1. All attendees will submit ONE simple question. Keep it simple (ie: what is love?)
2. Each attendee will have 2-3 minutes to explain their respective question, if they want. Be prepared to respond to any possible points of clarity from other attendees.
3. Round ONE: attendees vote for any question they want to discuss. Then, Jorge will tabulate the votes
4. Round TWO: top 2-3 questions are voted upon again. This round, attendees can ONLY VOTE for ONE QUESTION.
5. Discuss "winning question."
Historically, we have discussed top two questions, when circumstances permit.

Jorge will facilitate the discussion/conversation.

Reminders:
Be open-minded, bring your curiosity. It's about Discovery.
Always be Respectful and open to the perspective of others. And be concise.
