Dublin Advanced Toastmasters (DAT) is an Advanced Toastmaster club based in Dublin, Ohio. Although we recommend that new members already be a member of a Toastmasters club, there is no requirement to attend or join. Non-members are always encouraged to participate in our Table Topics session in which we practice extemporaneous speaking for 1 to 2 minutes.
