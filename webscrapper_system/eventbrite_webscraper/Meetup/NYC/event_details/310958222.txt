About the Event

⚠️ Women’s tickets are sold out. Men’s tickets are still available at a discounted rate—secure your spot before they’re gone!

This one’s for NYC singles in their 40s & 50s looking for real conversations, nostalgia, and new connections. Women’s spots are officially sold out (no tickets available), but men can still join — and at a special discounted rate!
If you grew up with mixtapes, rotary phones, and Friday night TV lineups that actually mattered, you’ll feel right at home. Gen X, expect an evening full of laughter, good energy, and authentic connections.

What to Expect:
💬 3-Minute Dates – Fun, structured rounds to meet everyone.
🎶 Nostalgic Icebreakers – First concerts, classic films, and TV shows we all remember.
📺 Shared Memories – From vinyl and disco to handwritten love letters, find common ground with people who lived it too.
Why Join?
Forget swiping — meet face-to-face in a relaxed, friendly environment where sparks can fly naturally. Whether you’re looking for romance or companionship, this is your chance to connect with singles who “get” your era.
