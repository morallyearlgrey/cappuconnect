Love is humanity’s oldest obsession. AI is our newest invention. Can machines experience, simulate, or even expand our notions of love—or are we just projecting our loneliness into silicon?

### Possible Pathways

Philosophical / Mythic Lens
Plato’s Symposium: love as yearning for completion.
Ovid’s Pygmalion: falling for one’s own creation (eerily close to chatbot romances).
Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: love denied to the artificial being.
Personal Experience
Would anyone here admit to feeling “attached” to an algorithm (Spotify recommendations, ChatGPT, even Tamagotchis)?
Where’s the line between affection, projection, and true relation?
Psychiatry & Love
Love as madness in the DSM vs love as healing in poetry.
Can AI simulate the attachment we crave when psychiatric systems medicate desire into silence?
Future Shock
If AI companions become indistinguishable from lovers, what happens to marriage, jealousy, betrayal?
Would an AI capable of love also be capable of heartbreak, or is that projection?

“What would a revolution of love look like if AI were part of it? Not just AI in place of love, but AI as a tool to expand the human capacity for love?”
