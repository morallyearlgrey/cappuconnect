This after-work tech happy hour drinks at Smithfield Hall won't disappoint! We'll get together on Thursday, October 16th at this popular Chelsea bar to chat, drink, and connect with techies, entrepreneurs, and tech enthusiasts from NYC and beyond.

Smithfield Hall is a classic sports bar. They have tons of beers on tap as well as a full bar, great snacks, and bar bites. Their convenient location makes it accessible for all of us!

Buy Us a Coffee (/Beer) if you enjoy our events and want to see more of them! :)

New York Tech & BeerÂ® is an NYC social tech drinks and networking community. We host happy hours at bars around the city and occasionally educational tech lectures. Join us to meet new friends, have fun, and maybe get a tip for a job! See you there.
