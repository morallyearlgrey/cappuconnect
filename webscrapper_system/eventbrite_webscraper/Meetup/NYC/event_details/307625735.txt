This is a karaoke event for shy & outgoing people! You can join us and be a wallflower or you can come with a professional studio set up and sing out Louise! We are also experimenting with having multiple singers unmuted so please bring an ethernet cable if you would like to test out some new low latency software that we are using so we can all sing together unmuted. We ask that your camera be turned on and when you request a song come ready to dance! This is a super inclusive and friendly environment. All songs are invited from Punk Rock to Motown To Backstreet Boys to Classic Rock to Hip Hop to R & B to Showtunes . . . did I miss anything? Yes I did. I missed so much. Anyways. Sign up. Be classy. Be weird. Come ready to dance and sing your heart out.

For professional studio coaching we can tell you what equipment you will need! Send us a message here on Meetup and we will coach you on everything you need to get/using what you already have.
