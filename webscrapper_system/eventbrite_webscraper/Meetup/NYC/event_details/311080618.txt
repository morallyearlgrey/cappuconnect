Meet New People - Dinner with Strangers
DayOfUs brings strangers together for unforgettable dinners. Every week, we curate group dining experiences at great local restaurants â€” you + five new faces. No awkward planning, no group chats that go nowhere â€” just good food, good vibes, and conversations that matter.

### Hereâ€™s how it works:

Take our quick quiz in the DayOfUs app to share your preferences.
We match you with a group of like-minded people.
We book the restaurant â€” you simply show up and enjoy.
You leave with new friends (and maybe a new favorite restaurant).

âœ¨ Not a dating app â€“ weâ€™re all about human connection and building friendships.

### Why Join Us?

Effortless â€“ We handle all the planning.
Fresh every week â€“ New people, new restaurants.
Personality-based matching â€“ Not just random pairings.
Local & traveler friendly â€“ Whether youâ€™re new in town or just looking to meet more people.
