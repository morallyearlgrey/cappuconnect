Let's all go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Met, on Saturday October 4th from 1pm - 3:30pm.

HISTORY

The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the world's largest and finest art museums. Its collection spans 5,000 years of world culture, from prehistory to the present and from every part of the globe. Founded in 1870, the Metropolitan Museum is located in New York City's Central Park along Fifth Avenue (from 80th to 84th Streets). Last year it was visited by 4.7 million people.

TICKET COST:

$0. That is NOT a typo. I am offering Free Admission to all 20 Members who RSVP Yes to this event, and do not cancel. In other words, when you RSVP, please make sure you can actually show up at the event, and I will personally present you with your ticket to the MET for $0.

This is the official link to the Map of The Met. If you get lost or arrive late, you can always locate where we are, as I have noted the Floor and the Gallery numbers we will be visiting.

THE EXHIBITIONS WE ARE GOING TO VISIT ON A SELF-GUIDED TOUR *

WE WILL BE VISITING 3 EXHIBITS (IF TIME ALLOWS!). THE FIRST TWO ARE THE GRAND COLLECTION OF ARTWORK FOR THE MET, WITH ALL THE MASTERS AS NOTED. THE THIRD EXHIBIT IS FOR BASEBALL AFICIONADOS WHO WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE BEST COLLECTIONS OF BASEBALL CARDS IN THE WORLD.

## European Paintings - 1250 - 1800

The Met's world-famed collection of European paintings in Galleries 600 - 641 on Floor 2 encompasses works of art from the 13th through the 19th centuries—from Giotto to Gauguin. Most, though not all, are displayed in the galleries of the Department of European Paintings. Others works of art can be found in the Lehman Collection, the Linsky Collection, The Met Cloisters, and in various period rooms. Apart from its many individual masterpieces by artists as diverse as Jan van Eyck, Caravaggio, and Seurat, the Museum possesses the most extensive collection of 17th-century Dutch art in the western hemisphere, including outstanding works by Frans Hals, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Its holdings of El Greco and Goya are the finest outside of Spain, while the survey it offers of French painting between neo-Classicism and post-Impressionism is second only to Paris, with extensive holdings of the work of Corot, Courbet, Manet, Monet, Degas, Cézanne, and Van Gogh.

## The Annenberg Collection: Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Masters

The Annenberg Collection in Galleries 818–826 on Floor 2 includes more than fifty works by eighteen of the most renowned artists working in France during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, among them Manet, Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Picasso.
The collection was assembled by Walter H. Annenberg (1908–2002) and his wife, Leonore Annenberg (1918–2009), over a period of four decades, beginning in the early 1950s. The Annenberg gift stipulates that the collection must be exhibited together and always remain on the premises of the Metropolitan Museum.

# Baseball Cards from the Collection of Jefferson R. Burdick

The Jefferson R. Burdick collection of ephemera at The Met in Gallery 774a on Floor 1M contains one of the most distinguished collections of historical baseball cards anywhere in the world. In 1947, Burdick (1900–1963), an electrician from Syracuse, New York, and avid collector of ephemera, began to donate in large batches his holdings of more than 300,000 trade cards, postcards, and posters to the Museum. Included in the donation were more than 30,000 baseball cards dating back to the 1880s. This exhibition features over one hundred cards dating from the nineteenth century to the 1950s. Produced using a variety of printing techniques and in a range of styles, the cards feature legends of the game from a bygone era.

* THE SELF-GUIDED TOUR

The self-guided tour we will undertake at The MET Museum is an experience where the member will explore independently, navigating their route through each exhibition, set their own pace, and decide where to stop, using the resources provided like the map of the museum, or the smartphone app for information and directions (see below). This format offers freedom and flexibility, balancing a structured plan with the ability to explore at one's own pace. I will be "guiding" the group by being with you during the tour of each exhibition, and giving you time to explore, and also notifying you of our group moving to the next exhibition.

AUDIO DEVICE FOR THE MET: In order to use the audio guides at the Met Museum, I highly recommend downloading the Bloomberg Connects App at https://www.bloombergconnects.org/. After you download the app, you can either go directly to the The Met Fifth Avenue, or use the QR codes at the Museum, and scan them directly with your phone for in-depth information from the Museum's art works.
