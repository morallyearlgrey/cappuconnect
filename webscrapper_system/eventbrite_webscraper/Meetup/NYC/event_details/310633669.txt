Details

Are you a mid-career professional stuck in a job that’s not a good fit, or in between jobs, and not sure what to look for next? This workshop will give you a jumpstart for your job search, helping you understand the obstacles that can make a search difficult, and then start addressing these by walking you through a “career vision” exercise.

You will gain more confidence and clarity about what you want to pursue, and you’ll create a written record of your goals and the details of your ideal job that you can refer back to throughout your job search.

Led by an experienced career coach who will facilitate discussions, leading you to reach deeper insights into what you want from a job. Come prepared to think, write, and share some of your thoughts with the group. Leave ready to continue your job search with a fresh perspective.

Geared toward people around 35-55 years old, wanting to change jobs or career paths in order to make the most of their experience and skills so that they can have a career that is meaningful to them.

Note: please plan to connect to zoom on a computer rather than a phone. I will be sharing a google doc to copy or download, which you will be writing on.
