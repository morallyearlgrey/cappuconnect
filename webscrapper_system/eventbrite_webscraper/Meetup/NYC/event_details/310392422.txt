**NEW JERSEY’S ULTIMATE SINGLES MEET-UP GROUP, WHERE THE FUN NEVER STOPS!
**

Join MINGLE AROUND SINGLES MEET-UP GROUP for an evening of awesome 80’s rock by DECADENCE, the East coasts favorite 80’s rock band… nothin’ but a good time!

The 80s extravaganza!

We present to you DECADENCE, the TRUE 80s extravaganza brought to you by four musicians who actually lived through the 80s. While some bands look like the 80s threw up on them, we strive to bring you our selection of the biggest 80s hits in a professional, less cringeworthy way while still being fun, high energy and entertaining! We are a Northern New Jersey/New York band and we have been playing the local circuit SINCE the decade of DECADENCE. We have appeared with and played aside Joel Hoekstra (Rock Of Ages on Broadway, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Trans Siberian Orchestra) Constantine Maroulis (American Idol, Rock Of Ages On Broadway) Ted Poley (Danger Danger, Prophet) and many more familiar names over the years

Angel: Lead Vocals and major ‘tude

Bruce: Vocals, Guitars and “this isn’t working” guy

PJ: Bass and great hair

Steve: “BANG DRUM!! THATS ME!! YEA YEA YEA”!!!!

Arrive at 8pm to find parking and seating and to socialize with MINGLE AROUND SINGLES MEETUP members before the 9pm performance.
