Hey yo! Let's go ..........................to the Poster House! This place has posters! Lots of em! It's FREE on FRIDAY! And on this day there's some mask printing event for $10 thats optional if you wanna do it.And theres some band called Whisper Doll playing and the tickets seem to be free if you just click where it says events and you can get 2.They sound kinda like a sad 90s band if thats what youre into.Here's some info about the stuff I mentioned!

Ill wait outside for 15 or 20 minutes so the latecomers have a chance to make it so we can go inside together.If you come late just call me and I'll try to find you.I dont really check messages on this site during the event so just call or text.

I dont really know if we are gonna eat after the event cause its hard to find a spot that everyone agrees on.Most likely we'll enjoy the museum and then go back to our lives of quiet desperation.

Look for a weird socially awkward bald guy awkwardly standing outside awkwardly in front of the awkward place.That's me.Come say Hi.
