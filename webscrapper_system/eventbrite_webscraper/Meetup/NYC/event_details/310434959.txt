DESCRIPTION

A highly interactive, skill-based workshop on how to deal with toxic behaviors and toxic environments and will include multiple perspectives, multiple lenses through which to look at toxicity (not just at work, but home, school, even church) – Psychological Safety, Trust, Employee Engagement and even Emotional Intelligence. Relevant, pertinent – we are living through the most toxic times I have ever seen or experienced in my lifetime.

SPEAKER BIO

Mauricio serves as a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) strategist, consultant, trainer, sexual harassment prevention trainer, emotional intelligence, unconscious bias, employee engagement/trust trainer, 360/executive coaching, and expert witness. He assists organizations with “winning the war for talent” and “being employers of choice” including Ombudsman/Retention Services (investigations, stay, exit,
post exit interviews). DTG’s headquarters are located in Herndon, Virginia.

While working as a demographic researcher for the Internal Revenue Service, Mauricio first anticipated the rise of diversity inside and outside the workplace. He had the good fortune to work with Dr. W. Edwards Deming, Peter F. Drucker, Drs. Crosby, Jurand, and Jerry Harvey. Mauricio credits much of his interest in human resource management and the earning of his MBA at George Washington University to their influences.

Mauricio and the DTG team - our focus, our work - has moved DTG toward this nexus or “sweet spot” where valuing diversity and being inclusive in workplace and marketplace intersects with respect, trust, employee engagement and higher performance. They believe if you respect all differences in your workplace, your people feel valued and respected and hence, they are more engaged and perform at a higher level. This is why we often focus on respect, trust, and employee engagement.

Mauricio has trained and educated over 1 million employees, managers, and executives in the areas of diversity, gender equity,
mentoring, respect, dignity in the workplace and marketplace, and trust and engagement in higher performance. He has worked
in every state but North Dakota and has traveled to more than 75 countries.

Tribes to Law Firms, Manufacturing, High- “gives back” – Co-Chair, Elimination of Prejudice, Past Chair, Institute for Conservation Leadership, Chair, Omega Alpha Chapter, Pi Lambda Phi, UVA (1st
