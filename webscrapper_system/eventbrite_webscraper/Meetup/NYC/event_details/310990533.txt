Jason Reynolds, the founder of Homerun Home Solutions, a real estate investment company focused on property flips and rentals in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley. Before launching his real estate career, Jason was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 2019 MLB Draft and spent three years playing minor league baseball. While still an athlete, he began investing in small multifamily properties in Allentown, PA.

After retiring from professional baseball in 2022, Jason transitioned full-time into real estate, officially launching Homerun Home Solutions and rapidly expanding his operations.

A graduate of Lehigh University with a degree in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Jason brings a highly analytical and systems-driven approach to real estate — using data, innovative acquisition strategies, and creative financing to scale his business.
