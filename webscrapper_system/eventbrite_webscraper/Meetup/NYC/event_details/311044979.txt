Join us for this series of discussions of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his Meditations. Rather than a read-through, this series will focus on key passages and themes from each of Marcus' 12 Books (chapters). Outside reading is not required, but for those interested in reading ahead, this session will cover book 5 of The Meditations. All are welcome, and newcomers are encouraged to check us out. Our format involves reading and conversing about the material, but you are always welcome to just listen. We'll be on Zoom and the link will be posted just prior to the meeting time. You can find a free, online version of the meditations here:
