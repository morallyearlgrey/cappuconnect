Event Description
Emily Warren Roebling Plaza will become an open-air time capsule showcasing more than 90 years of New York City bus history. Four stars of the museum’s vintage fleet will take center stage.

Organizers are promising a few surprise guest vehicles—rare appearances that even veteran transit buffs might not have seen in person. All will be open for boarding, offering the chance to explore the interiors and imagine a commute when the fare was just a nickel.
