Patterns is a Knapsack-hosted summit for senior product, design, and engineering leaders and we’d love for you to be part of it. It's free to attend, with lunch and happy hour covered. (Please note: you must apply and be accepted)

“The energy in a room full of people who love what they do is electric. I’m so grateful I got to spend the day talking about design, catching up with some of my favorite people, and meeting amazing new folks.”

What is Patterns?
A one-day, invite-only event designed for candid, strategic conversation. Expect interactive workshops, expert-led panels, and open dialogue on the real challenges facing today’s product orgs.

We’ll be digging into topics like:

Executive pressure to restructure or reduce design in the age of AI
Keeping UX quality intact on AI-first roadmaps
Making AI work within legacy systems and infrastructure
Modernizing outdated tools and workflows without losing velocity
Leading through team change and cross-functional complexity

"It was outstanding. I’ve attended multi-day conferences with less valuable content than what this half-day summit delivered."

What makes it different?
It’s a small, curated room of leaders from companies like Wells Fargo, Apple, JP Morgan Chase, Nike, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon, Starbucks, AirBnB, IBM, Pinterest and more, sharing experiences and strategies in a focused, collaborative setting.

"Sometimes it's rare to just share a passion with strangers, but the caliber of the attendees was by far some of the best people I've had the opportunity to spend time with. "

How to apply
Patterns is free to attend, but space is limited to just 30 participants. Attendance is by application only. The event is free with lunch and happy hour covered by Knapsack.
