Each Friday at 1 PM ET, we open the floor for community members to give short 2-3 minute demos or explanations of how they're using AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and more — in their businesses, careers, or everyday life. After each share, we open it up for a few minutes of questions and discussion.

No fluff. Just real examples, practical takeaways, and the occasional “Wait…you can do that with AI?!”
