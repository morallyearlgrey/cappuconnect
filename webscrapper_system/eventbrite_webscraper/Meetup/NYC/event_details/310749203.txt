Session: Build Great Products with Quality and Empathy

Speaker: Christina Thalayasingam

Session Overview:
Too often, testers are portrayed as people who “prove developers wrong,” while quality is seen as someone else’s responsibility. Christina Thalayasingam challenges this mindset, emphasizing that quality and empathy are shared responsibilities across the entire engineering team.
Drawing from her experience managing an engineering team for Northwestern Mutual’s client website, Christina will share how her team integrates functional and non-functional testing, alongside strong user empathy, to ensure products are not just “done” but genuinely useful and user-friendly.

Attendees will learn how embedding these values into team culture improves both processes and product outcomes, fostering collaboration, continuous improvement, and customer-centric development.

Key Takeaways

Collaborative Approach: Everyone owns product quality
User-Centric Focus: Empathy drives better product decisions
Continuous Improvement: Build processes and culture that enable high-quality delivery
