Join us as we set goals, do focused work sprints, and celebrate our wins! We do accountability check-ins, usually every 30-60 minutes, and this can help boost our focus, motivation, and follow-through.

Whether you're reading, responding to emails, cleaning, or doing creative work, the shared office/caf√© vibe we create can make it easier to stay on task. This can be especially helpful for students, entrepreneurs, and anyone working from home.

At the start, we share our goals for the round (or the day, as you choose.) Then we mute and work on them. Rounds usually lasts 55 minutes, but they can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours!
At the end of a round, we'll open a "check-in" breakout room, where we can unmute and share how the round went and/or our next goals. You're equally welcome to skip the check-ins and continue focusing, by staying in the main room.
Feel free to drop in and out anytime, as much as it helps!
Having your camera on during the focus rounds (i.e., in the Main Zoom Room, in between our check-ins) is also encouraged, but not mandatory. You may find that this can also help your focus on your tasks due to the "body doubling" effect, as explained in this video: https://youtu.be/ni9biXNDZe0

Notes:

If you are new to the group, welcome!! To help foster a sense of safety, camaraderie and community, everyone must be willing to check-in with their camera on and at least once (i.e., at least once a day, for those who participate regularly.)
This event has a 2-hour waiting period. At the start of a session, if no one else is present, I'll remain in the Zoom room for up to 2 hours. I may end a session early if: (a) No one joins within those first 2 hours, or (b) Everyone who did join has left after the 2-hour mark.
