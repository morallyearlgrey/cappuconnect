Decrease cost and management effort with Fabric SQL DB with Warwick Rudd and Ginger Grant.

#### Description

Businesses today want well designed databases which can be used not only by applications but are part of an analytical solution which allows people to interact visually with the data in reports. Are you interested in decreasing and centralizing your Azure costs while continuing to support applications which need a SQL database? Are you interested in migrating an on-premises SQL Server database to the cloud or move away from decentralized manage instance databases? Fabric SQL DB can be the solution as it provides the ability to combine SQL Server functionality with Business Intelligence Analysis.

For many existing applications, having a SQL Database is a requirement. We will review the processes for doing maintenance for SQL DB inside of Microsoft Fabric, focusing on the “knob free” methods to minimize the steps involved and migration from an on prem database. We will examine the different cost models to demonstrate how this solution can be used to minimize costs and decrease management effort through automated maintenance and centralized resource monitoring.

This session will provide you with the use cases to determine when and why an SQL DB inside of Fabric can benefit your data environment.
