We provide a supportive and positive learning experience in which members are empowered to develop communication and leadership skills, resulting in greater self-confidence and personal growth. Based in Mississauga, ON - we were meeting at the Malton Community Centre but now meet online. Contact us for the meeting link at creekbanktm@gmail.com
