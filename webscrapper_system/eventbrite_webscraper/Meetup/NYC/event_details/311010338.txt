Spot the signs. Learn the lessons. Grow from the experience.
We’ve all missed the red flags at some point. We’ve all had those “I should’ve known” moments. But those experiences don’t have to define us — they can teach us.

Join us for a revealing and supportive workshop where we dive into the patterns, warning signs, and emotional turning points that shaped past relationships — and how to use that insight to create better ones moving forward.

- Common red flags we tend to overlook (and why we do it)
- Regrets and what they’re trying to teach us
- Powerful realizations that lead to emotional growt

This is a safe space to reflect, learn, and (if you’d like) share your experience. No judgment, just real talk.

All are welcome — singles, dating, separated, or simply curious.
Let’s turn red flags into green lights for self-awareness and real change.

This group is brought to you by the Dianetics & Scientology life improvement center.
