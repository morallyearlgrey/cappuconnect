We will meet for a discussion of the book 1984 by George Orwell (one of the most upvoted books in a previous "Bring Your Own Book" event).

To attend this event, you should have read this book and be able to partake in discussions on this book.

From the publisher:

1984 has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. That Orwell's book was published in 1949 and remains completely relevant today is a testament both to his powers as a prophet and to the possibility that the future he envisioned may yet come to pass. The story takes place in London in 1984, a world of perpetual war, pervasive government surveillance, and incessant public mind control, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism (Ingsoc) under the control of a privileged Inner Party elite.

In 1984, Orwell presents a chilling vision of totalitarianism through the story of Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in the nation of Oceania. Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to rewrite historical records to match the Party's ever-changing version of events. The novel explores themes of truth, freedom, and individuality as Winston struggles against a system designed to crush the human spirit through constant surveillance, propaganda, and the manipulation of language and thought itself.

Bring an open mind and a smile! I hope to see you there.
