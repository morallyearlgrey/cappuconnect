Can you always say what you really mean? Are you a bit apprehensive about speaking out in meetings? If so, you are in good company.

Do you always listen to people? Do you always hear what they are trying to say? If not, you are in good company. Can you respond well to ad hoc questions? Do you provide feedback in a way that others are excited and willing to become even more active? Do you run meetings as effectively as you want to? Are you the leader you want to be?

Toastmasters will show you how to become a confident, effective speaker, a listener, an evaluator, and run interesting and effective meetings through an enjoyable, thoroughly professional program. Adults learn best by doing, and that is how Toastmasters works. A Toastmasters Club provides a safe environment for you to start speaking.

We are now an online club. Check our website: cptm.toastmastersclubs.org for more information
