Code and Coffee is an inclusive, informal co-working session. People of all skill levels attend, and we love it that way. Many people (optionally) bring projects to work on, and many other people (optionally) socialize the entire time. It's entirely up to you!

The Intro Circle
Near the beginning of the event (2:30 pm), we do a standup in a circle:

We first share organizer announcements, updates, and logistics

Introductions (7 secs max):

Your name
Tech/coding topic(s) you want to talk about
Non-tech topic(s) you want to talk about
Job opportunities you're hiring for OR announce that you are looking for one. If none, that's cool.

After the introduction circle, everything is self-organized. We sometimes have FEATURES in a nearby room; check out those events on Meetup as well.
Doors close at 4:00pm. Please keep us updated in the comments if you're intending to show up late, as we want to ensure our venue hosts are able to clean up in time to get out by 5pm and enjoy their weekends.
