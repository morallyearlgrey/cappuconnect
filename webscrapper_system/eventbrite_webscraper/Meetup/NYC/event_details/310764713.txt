This meeting will be a Zoom meeting.

You can access the Zoom link by RSVPing to the event. The link will show up on the event page. There is a waiting room, but no password should be required. The link will not remain constant from week to week, so please only click the link for the current event to avoid confusion.

The format is as follows:
Once members have joined, a brief overview of the group and how meetings are run will be explained. The moderator will then solicit topics from those in attendance. Please vote for ONLY ONE topic. After the topic is selected, we will discuss it, taking turns until approximately 9:00. We will commence last words at that time, during which anyone in attendance is allowed to share any final thoughts. We hang out to have informal discussions after the main meeting.

Please mute yourself (and remain muted during the main meeting) while the discussion is occurring. Itâ€™s disruptive when people choose to stay unmuted, and the moderator and/or hosts have to repeatedly re-mute that person.

Creativity, enthusiasm, and engaged interaction with the topic and other membersâ€™ ideas are the cornerstone of the group. Thanks, everyone, for making Montclair Socrates Cafe such a great group! ðŸ˜Š
