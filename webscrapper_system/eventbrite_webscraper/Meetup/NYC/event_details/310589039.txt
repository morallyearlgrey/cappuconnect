We are heading to TriBeCa! Cheffrey 👨‍🍳 will be cooking for a NYRR Running Group (they will be coming back from a Training Run, but come as you are!) and you're invited to his abode! If you've been to my Popups, you'll realize that NO ONE LEAVES HUNGRY. IYKYK. Eat til you drop 😂. Whether you are currently with a walking group, run-walk group (Galloway), or training for a race, this counts! The only caveat is you cannot currently be enrolled with another Paid Training Group as we don't want no beef. PLEASE BE ON TIME!!! 😊

This menu will be Veg friendly but come with an open mind and palate
