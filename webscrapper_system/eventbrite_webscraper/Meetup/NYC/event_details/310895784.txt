The 13th Annual Momo Crawl and Block Party officially begins on Sunday, September 21st at 12.00PM at Diversity Plaza and along 37th Road between 74th and 75th Street.

It’s bigger, steamier and spicier than ever! Get ready to stroll through the streets of Queens, NY where the air smells like momo and chilli.

Join U30X and hundreds of momo maniacs as we celebrate the world’s largest momo festival, all while showing love to the amazing local, immigrant owned spots that make this neighborhood absolutely legendary.

Please note that this is a ticketed event. The regular Momo Crawl Passports are available for $15 and can be picked up day of. One passport will give one holder access to taste participating restaurants’ Momo for $1 a piece.
