Please note that our group and our happy hours are not for non-Asians.

Our monthly happy hour is our flagship event that started it all years ago in 2005. Experience what it's all about -- come and meet fellow Asian professionals in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Relax after work and meet some new Asian people.

Because this is a free event, we humbly request that you buy one drink or more to support our venue since they are turning away other business to allow us to host our event (buying alcoholic drinks/soft drinks/bottled water helps support the venue -- getting free tap/iced water does not).

First time to one of our events? See photos from previous happy hours on Meetup or Facebook.

Hope to see you there!
