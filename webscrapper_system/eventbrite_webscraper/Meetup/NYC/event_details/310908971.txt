We meet every Thursday. Present your products/services at our unique event for 3-5 minutes. Calling on entrepreneurs, sales professionals, insurance agents, business coaches, realtors, mortgage brokers, tax accountants...

Each speaker will share information on their products/services through presentations, stories and sharing of samples, literature, and business cards.

We provide a supportive, noncompetitive environment for our members. If you choose not to give a presentation you can still participate in the networking part of our events.
