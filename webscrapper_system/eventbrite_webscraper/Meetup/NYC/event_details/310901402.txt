Dress, Dreams, & Desire: Fashion & Psychoanalysis is the first exhibit to explore the complex relationship between fashion and psychoanalysis. Curated by Dr. Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at FIT, the exhibition will feature approximately 100 looks by designers such as Alexander McQueen, Elsa Schiaparelli, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Gianni & Donatella Versace, John Galliano for Christian Dior Haute Couture, Rick Owens, Thierry Mugler, Vivienne Westwood, and many more. Described by Suzy Menkes as "the Freud of Fashion," Steele has spent more than five years working on this exhibition and her accompanying book. Drawing on the evolution of psychoanalytic ideas about sexuality and the unconscious, she includes sections devoted to the mirror stage, the skin ego, desire and sexual difference.

Let's meet at the Museum at FIT, North West corner of 27th & 7th Avenue to enjoy the exhibit. Afterwards we can head to Gregory's on 29th & 7th for coffee, tea, nibbles to chat/converse & chill.
