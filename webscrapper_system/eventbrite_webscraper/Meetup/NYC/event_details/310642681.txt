Are you new to volunteering with Code for Philly? Join us for Code for Philly 101! Code for Philly welcomes civic tech enthusiasts of all kinds! You don't have to be an expert or seasoned technologist to participate! We welcome people with all sorts of skillsets: Developers/engineers, designers, project managers, event planners, community liaisons, civic engagement specialists, artists, anyone! If you're interested in getting involved in any way, this event is for you!

In this brief (okay, hour and a half) session, we'll go over the basics of Code for Philly, civic tech, and how to get involved in the Code for Philly community. We will go over each of our projects. You'll also have a chance to meet others in the community!

This will be a virtual call (we'll send out the link a few days before). Most of our team meetings are virtual, but we do meet every second Tuesday at Indy Hall for our Hack Nights. 101s are a prerequisite for attending Hack Nights.
