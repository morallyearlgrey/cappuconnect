Let’s meet virtually over Zoom for an honest, relaxed conversation about the ups and downs of dating in our 50s+. Whether you’re newly single, have been flying solo for a while, or are in an early stage relationship, this is a space to share stories, ask questions, and get support and guidance — from each other and from a certified life coach who’s been in the trenches and come out wiser (and a little more chill) on the other side. So grab a drink from your fridge, get comfy, and join the convo.

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SPEED DATING EVENT (sorry folks). This group is a respectful, judgment-free space for open conversation, sharing and learning.
