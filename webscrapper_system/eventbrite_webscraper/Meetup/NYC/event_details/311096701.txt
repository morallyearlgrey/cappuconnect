This is the Monday night meeting for Orlando Stoics. It's online.

Seneca is one of the major ancient Stoics, partly because his writings were very revealing, and partly because his works have survived so much history. This Monday, weâ€™ll review an article by Ryan Holiday plus an AEON article with an introduction by Massimo. Hope you can join us!

Our group enjoys open-minded, respectful conversations on Stoicism and how it relates to science, culture, philosophy, other belief systems, and even pop culture (books and movies). Sometimes "we agree to disagree", but the long-term goal is to improve our minds via group discussions.

In general, Stoicism teaches us how to handle difficult people and events, how to avoid anger and worry, and overall to use moderation in all aspects of our lives.

This meeting is free and open to the public.
