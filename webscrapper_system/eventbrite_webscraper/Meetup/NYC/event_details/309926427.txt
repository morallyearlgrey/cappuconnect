Hey! Join us at Clinton Hall on E 51st from 7pm-11pm for some board games!

We primarily play party games such as Codenames, Just One, Anomia, Exploding/Zombie Kittens, Telestrations, and One Night Werewolf. We find those are easy to play/learn and get people having fun and maybe making a few new friends along the way! We have quite a few games, but if there is a particular game(s) you would like to play, please feel free to bring them along. We love learning and playing new games!

A $2 donation for game upkeep is optional, but always appreciated. Venmo QR code will be available if you prefer not to carry cash.

Come alone or bring a friend, new players welcome! We look forward to seeing you all!
