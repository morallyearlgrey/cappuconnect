As Java developers, we pride ourselves on handling edge cases in our code, but what about edge cases in the Java language itself?
Join us for an interactive session with certification book author Jeanne Boyarsky as she uncovers real-world Java “gotchas”, quirks, and surprises you’re likely to encounter in your day-to-day coding (not just puzzlers for entertainment). You’ll explore fresh language twists introduced in Java 17 through Java 25 (scheduled for Sept 16 release), along with a few timeless classics, and leave with sharper instincts to recognize and avoid these hidden pitfalls in your own applications.

Thunder Talk: Introduction to AI Agents
Speaker: Frank Greco, NYJavaSIG Founder, Java Champion
Ever wonder what the heck AI agents are? This short session breaks down how tools (function-calling) and reasoning models combine to form agents**,** ie, intelligent entities that can complete tasks on their own. We’ll start by clarifying what tools are, then show how agents build on that concept using LangChain4j.
