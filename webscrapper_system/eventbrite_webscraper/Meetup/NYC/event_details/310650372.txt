Let's be honest...

Most "professional development" events are garbage.

Death by PowerPoint.

Forced vulnerability circles.

Icebreakers that make you want to fake a family emergency.

This isn't that.

This is for curious professionals who want to try something that might actually work.

We're testing out some unconventional methods for building confidence, sparking creativity, and connecting with people without the corporate cringe.

No slides. No handouts. No trust falls.

Just 2 hours of experimenting with techniques that make meetings less terrible and teams more human.

Perfect for:

Leaders who want fresh approaches
Anyone who wants to think faster on their feet (especially at work)
People who secretly think work could be more fun
Professionals who learn better by doing than listening

Come see what the fuss is about.

Worst case? You get some new tools and meet some interesting people.

Best case? You discover something that changes how you think about leadership.

We also hang out afterwards for anyone who wants to keep the conversation going!

For attendees of this event we will provide a 75% discount code for the next custom-made event called "ImproVessional: Make your team innovate while having fun like never before‚Äù
