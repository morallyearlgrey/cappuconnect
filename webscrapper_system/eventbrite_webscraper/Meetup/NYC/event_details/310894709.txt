Hey neighbors, happy September! üçÅ

Our next evening meetup will be on Wed, September 24th at 6:30pm.

As per usual, we'll be hosting the meetup at Our House Queens, a co-working & event space here in Astoria.

This month, in addition to our usual rapid demos, we'll have NYC Mesh do a presentation on the project, the goals for Astoria, and maybe a live technical demo if we're lucky!

It'll be a night of learning and discussion, so come out and hang with the local tech & tech-adjacent community.

See you there. ‚úåÔ∏è

AGENDA:

6:30 - 7:15pm: Open discussion
7:15 - 8:00pm: Rapid demos, NYC Mesh presentation
8:00 - 8:30pm: Open discussion
