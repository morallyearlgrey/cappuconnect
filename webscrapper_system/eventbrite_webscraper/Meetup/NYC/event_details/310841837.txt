About the Venue:
Flûte Bar & Lounge opened in midtown Manhattan in 1997, taking over the space that once housed the notorious speakeasy, Club Intime. At Flûte Midtown, they bring champagne out of the nightclub VIP room and into the stylish, intimate setting of a New York lounge. It’s the perfect spot for champagne lovers, those looking for a great place to have drinks with friends, bring a date, toast a celebration, or relax with colleagues. In addition to champagne and sparkling wine, Flûte offers a full bar and a menu of specialty sparkling cocktails and small plates.
