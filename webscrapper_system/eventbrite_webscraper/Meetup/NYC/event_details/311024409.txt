Software Book Club is a ~biweekly online gathering for curious builders from all backgrounds to discuss software engineering practices. Every meeting, our discussion will be grounded in something written by a developer.

We value socratic inquiry, healthy debate, bike-shedding, war stories, and most of all, learning and craft!

Participation is purely interest-based. No one‚Äôs taking attendance, nor expected to join every session.

There is no goal but to exchange perspectives and opinions on best practices, interpret ideas and whether they‚Äôve stood the test of time, give examples to things we don't understand üïäÔ∏è

This Event

Ground rules

Read the text beforehand. Come with questions and interpretations.
We want everyone to get a chance to speak or raise questions. So while we welcome speaking up, we encourage being mindful of other participants.
It's ok to spectate if you're shy or tired, but since this is an activity grounded in discussion, we'd also appreciate that you introduce yourself or interact with the subject on chat.

In keeping with the contributor convenant, we don't tolerate harassment, abuse, elitism or unwelcoming behaviour.
