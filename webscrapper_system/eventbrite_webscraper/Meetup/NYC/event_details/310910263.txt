A quick word on Startup+
We kicked this off in 2021, in the middle of the pandemic, because Zoom mixers just werenâ€™t cutting it. Fastâ€‘forward: 25k members, 75+ mixers, 12 pitch nights, and 6000 folks through the doors. We keep it simpleâ€”connect good people and let the magic happen.

Headsâ€‘up: capacity is capped. Only confirmed Luma RSVPs are admitted at the door. Walkâ€‘ins = no go.
