Please join our partner event with the Humanist Association Orange County Social Justice Now initiative as we present â€œIs Empathy Toxic? Are there members of our society who express less empathy and compassion, and engage in more cruelty and malevolent behaviors? Current and past research critically explore this, providing insights and establishing substantial evidence into this phenomena. Discussion will be followed by Q/A, and will focus on the aspects presented in the research of how currently observed societal behaviors are being demonstrated and expressed.

Please be prepared for an interesting, enlightening, and critical thinking discussion. As always, our focus will remain on the subject presented, engage open-minded active listening skills, non-violent communication practices, and help us ensure that we create a comfortable environment open to all viewpoints. We hope you will join us for this important and current social issue.
