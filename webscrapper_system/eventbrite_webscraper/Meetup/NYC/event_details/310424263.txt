A casual, high-energy stroll for borderless builders. Meet founders, PMs, and creators on the JC waterfront.

No panels. No agenda. Just a casual, high-energy walk along the Jersey City waterfront with local and visiting techies, product managers, Founders Without Borders, creators, and innovators. We’ll talk shop—latest products, AI trends, building in public, career moves—and swap ideas on how we can support each other across cities and borders. Come ready to share, listen, and spark collaborations.
​The vibe

​A friendly, curious crowd rooted in JC’s growing tech scene (and friends from out of town)
​Conversations that move (literally)
​Coffee stops with quick “micro-rotations” so you meet new people
​Wrap-up mixer at a local spot to keep good convos going
​Zero pressure to meet everyone—we’ll share a networking sheet afterward

​Who it’s for

​Big tech, startup, and indie builders in/around JC + NYC
​PMs, designers, engineers, creators
​Global, and cross-border founders/operators (AKA Founders Without Borders)
​Anyone curious about tech and community—locals and visitors welcome
