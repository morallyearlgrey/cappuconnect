Looking to connect with other introverts?

You've found us. Join us in a low key atmosphere to talk about life as an introvert and the personal and professional challenges that sometimes come with it. We get together to do what introverts do best have deep meaningful conversation about things that matter. We share our thoughts, stories, ideas and most importantly we share our support for our fellow introverts in the Triangle.

Topics may include:
• relationships
• work
• "networking"
• socializing
• communication
• hobbies and interests
• spirituality
• activism and politics
• good reads
• advantages of being an introvert
• personal stories about life as an introvert

You are welcome to keep your video off during the meeting, honor your introvert self :)

Please read the event guidelines before RSVPing:
• Do all that we can to honor eachother with love, kindness, and compassion
• Please ONLY RSVP if you will come (that way it doesn't take away
from someone who does want to join but can't because of a no-show)
• Update your RSVP as soon as you know you cannot attend (Please do this at least a day in advance ~if you can~ so those on the waitlist have enough time to arrange their schedules and attend)

Very important: Creating and Maintaining a Safe Space in our Meetings

Please check that your audio is working before attending the meeting and that you have familiarized yourself with the chat function in case your audio is not working so that you can respond via chat.
Please know that the attendees at our Introvert meetings are brave in attending and sharing. Because of this we ask that all attendees participate in create a safe space for all in attendance. We do this by introducing ourselves, where we're calling from and answer the initial prompt. After this you are welcome to pass for the remainder of the meeting. Because of the atmosphere of safety we create in these meetings, only listening and not participating during the introduction is not an option. We establish a safe space when we all are in it together, having all participated in the introductions - this sets us up for a very beautiful meeting with lots of heart-felt sharing.
**If you have issues with your audio, our group organizer will invite you to respond in the chat and she will read your response. You will have about 1 minute to respond via chat if you are having audio issues, after this you will be removed from the group. Please do not log back on if you have been removed as this is distracting and detracts from the meeting. If you do attempt to log back in after you have been removed from the group, you will be blocked from the call so as not to interrupt the organizer's ability to facilitate the meeting. This does not mean you have been blocked from the group. It is not personal and you are more than welcome to join us for the next call the following month. Thank you for understanding and helping to create and maintain this Safe Space, and for helping our meetings go as smoothly as possible.
