Join us for an evening of Stoic philosophy and discussion. We'll kick off the event with a short presentation exploring one of the core ideas of Stoicism, focusing on its real-world application with some practices drawn from the texts. Following the presentation, we'll break into smaller groups for a lightly-facilitated discussion about the topic.

This week, we’ll be discussing courage, bravery, and freedom. We’ll also be going over a couple practices; one to get over our fears of embarrassment and another to get over our fears of everything else.

Here's the video we'll be watching: https://youtu.be/G1nM9UCJCIs?si=8Ll8J-3-Y_VwQhsi&t=3731

Thanks so much for your interest, and please remember:

"There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbor, if you would live for yourself." - Seneca, Letters from a Stoic, Letter 48
