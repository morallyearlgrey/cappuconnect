Fresh off my presentation at The MoneyShow Toronto, I’m bringing the same insights directly to our Meetup community.

In this session, I’ll walk you through a practical strategy for generating monthly income from the stock market — without chasing risky trades or overcomplicating things.

You’ll learn:

✅ Why focusing on established companies (like those in the Dow 30) can be a safer path
✅ How selling cash-secured puts works as a powerful income tool
✅ Simple chart techniques that make timing clearer and decision-making easier

This is about taking control of your investing, creating consistency, and building confidence.

Who this is for:

Investors who want reliable monthly income
Beginners who want a clear, no-jargon explanation of income strategies
Anyone who wants to better understand stock charts and market timing

✨ Come ready to learn, ask questions, and see how you can apply this strategy in your own portfolio.
