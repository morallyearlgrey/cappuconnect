Unlike the deities of myth who embody distinct characters and domains, the Christian God emerges as an absolute Judge—incorruptible, mysterious, and remote from human comprehension. Rooted in the Judaic tradition, this God is not bound by natural law or predictable bias, but may demand of believers even the unthinkable, as seen in Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac. In this vision, faith requires readiness, discipline, and the refusal to let any gift become more important than the Giver.
