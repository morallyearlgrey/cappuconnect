To improve your speaking, thinking and listening skills, come to Sheridan Park Toastmasters Club which was established in 1974.

We are a group of people who love to improve our public speaking skills, impromptu speaking skills, and leadership skills while having fun. Many of our members seek to improve communication skills like presentation skills, networking skills, impromptu speaking skills, improving their confidence with English as a second language, leadership skills, evaluation skills, and so many more. We usually have 10-15 people at our meetings and not everyone indicates attendance on meetup.com as we promote on multiple platforms (in other words our attendance is not what you will see on meetup.com.

Attend as our guest anytime and observe how we learn to communicate more effectively in a fun-filled and supportive environment.

Join our club and we'll have you speaking comfortably in no time! We are a truly a "community based" club.

We offer a light hearted and nurturing learning environment.

We are a vibrant club open to all people- come meet us. We will welcome you with an open heart and encouragement to become a vibrant confident speaker.

There are no strangers at our club - just friends you haven't met.
