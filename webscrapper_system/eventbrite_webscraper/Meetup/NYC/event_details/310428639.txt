Toastmasters is an amazing organization if you're looking to develop your communication and leadership skills. We're about more than public speaking! Come also to learn how to speak impromptu, how to chair meetings, give constructive feedback and develop your leadership skills.

The environment is safe and encouraging. We practice sharing feedback that helps each other grow. If you have stage fright, a fear of public speaking, want to learn skills to advance or be promoted at work, etc. then come check us out.

The agenda includes prepared speeches, impromptu speaking (guests are encouraged to participate) and evaluation.
