Grab your frisbee, volleyball, or footballâ€”and bring something delicious to share (just not too many chips, lol)! Let's celebrate the arrival of fall and continue enjoying nature!

Don't forget to bring a towel, chair, or blanket to sit on!

We'll be meeting by the entrance to Central Park on W 66th St & Central Park West (look for the red X on the meetup photo). Call or text Steven at 646-238-9910.

Looking forward to spending some fun times with you! See you soon!
