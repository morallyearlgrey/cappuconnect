Greetings Fellow Cosmonauts!

This is a placeholder for our regular Wednesday night meetings. I will post the details here for each particular event once I have them. In the meantime, feel free to RSVP, comment, or check out the CotC Discord Server for all the latest science-y gifs and links:

All of our events for this foreseeable future will be virtual. You may access the event via the link below:

The zoom meeting will open at 8PM. The viewing will start promptly at 8:25PM. You are welcome to join/leave the video chat at anytime without penalty or comment. Same goes for RSVPs - they're appreciated, but not mandatory.

There is an optional suggested donation of $2 which helps pay for our group membership to The Great Courses Plus. You can donate through the following methods:

Venmo: @reece-daniel

Paypal: https://www.paypal.me/reecedaniel

You can also donate through meetup.com, but they take a 17% cut!!

Looking forward to seeing everyone Wednesday!
