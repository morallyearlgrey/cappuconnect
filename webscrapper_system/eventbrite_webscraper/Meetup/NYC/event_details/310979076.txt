Join us and experience the rebirth of "Candle" — New York City's cherished beacon of vegan gastronomy, rekindled in 2023. Following the closure of the iconic Candle Cafe, Candle 79, and Candle Cafe West in 2019 and 2020, the spirit of Candle has been reignited in a vibrant new venue. This revival is more than just a restaurant; it's a homage to nearly three decades of pioneering vegan cuisine, encapsulating the soulful history and cherished memories of its predecessors.

VegNews: "Candle is back and better than ever ... The restaurant is serving many of the iconic dishes that made the Candle family of vegan restaurants a longtime favorite among foodies and inspired vegan chefs nationwide with their impressive gourmet cookbooks..."

HappyCow: "... offers a variety of items such as tofu & seitan dishes, greens & vegetables, chimichurri skewers, mezze platter, grilled kale salad, polenta fries, and more..."

BirdEye: “The menu features a variety of delicious and healthy dishes, none of which are too heavy. Choose from sandwiches like the Tuscan seitan Parmesan sandwich or the Mediterranean wrap, all kinds of salads, and larger dishes like mole grilled tofu or Tuscan lasagna."

For those of you who have never attended one of our Meetup events: this is an incredibly friendly & welcoming group. It will be easy to find our group: we are taking over the majority of the restaurant. Also, everyone pays for their own meal. Easy!

Where to Meet: Look for us inside or ask the staff if needed.
