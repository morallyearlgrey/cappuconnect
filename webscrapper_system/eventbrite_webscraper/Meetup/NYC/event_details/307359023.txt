Toronto Skeptics in the Pub Event: We will be doing an online event using Zoom video conferencing this month. We do not have a speaker or presentation, so we will be having a free and open discussion with a friendly group of skeptically minded people. We will also be checking in, just to see how everyone is doing.

The video conference link will be available to anyone who RSVPs for this event, or you can email johnburdett@sympatico.ca and ask for access to the Skeptics Meetup, and the link to the Zoom video conference will be emailed back to you.

Zoom is very easy to use, but you might want to download the free app before the meeting, and play with it a bit to get used to using it.

Zoom allows you to control your microphone and camera. You can mute your microphone so that no one can hear you, and you can start or stop your video feed, so that people can either see you or not. I will initially let everyone control their own microphone, so we can have discussions, but if there are too many people, or if it gets too chaotic, I will mute all microphones. There is a “raise hand” feature that will allow people to request permission to speak. Zoom also includes a chat feature which allows you to send text messages to everyone in the conference, or privately to one other individual.
