Let’s Science!

Join us on Zoom. The Zoom room will open at 6:30 PM.

New to Science Readers? Please contact Ruth Light at
ruthlight1 @ comcast.net for readings and Zoom link. (Previous Science Readers members do not need to contact Ruth.)

Each month the HFFC Science Readers group tackles new information from current science explorations. Short articles or videos are selected to review beforehand, for a general introduction to the discussion or presentation. Ruth will email a couple of brief “readings” about a week before the meeting. No books, just articles and videos.

“Join our lively group to learn and have fun.”

Note: HFFC Science Readers is for HFFC members and first time guests only.
