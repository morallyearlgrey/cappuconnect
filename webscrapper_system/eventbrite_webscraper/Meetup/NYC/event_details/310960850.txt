Living in Modern Times – Discussion Meetup
Life today moves faster than ever before. Technology, social media, work demands, and global challenges all shape the way we live, think, and connect. This discussion-based meetup is a space to pause, reflect, and share perspectives on what it really means to live in modern times.
We’ll explore questions like:
How do we balance speed with slowness?
What challenges and opportunities come with constant connectivity?
How do modern pressures affect relationships, work, and personal wellbeing?
Come solo or with a friend—this is a relaxed, welcoming environment where everyone’s voice matters. Bring your curiosity, an open mind, and a willingness to share or simply listen.
