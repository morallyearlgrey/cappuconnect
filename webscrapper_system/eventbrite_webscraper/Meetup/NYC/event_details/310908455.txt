On Saturday September 26th, see Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger to Celebrate National Silent Film Day. Before Psycho and Rear Window, Alfred Hitchcock made his mark with The Lodger - a silent-era thriller brimming with suspense and style, what he would come to consider his true directorial debut. Set in a fog-drenched London gripped by fear, the film follows a mysterious tenant who may or may not be the serial killer known as "The Avenger." With moody cinematography, a shadowy leading man, and Hitchcock’s first cameo, this early gem showcases the director’s budding genius. Register for Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger on Saturday September 26th.
