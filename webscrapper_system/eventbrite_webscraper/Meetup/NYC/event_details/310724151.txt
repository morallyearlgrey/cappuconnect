Are you plagued by thoughts about the world we live in? Consumed by a need to make sense of the chaos, contradictions, and absurdities of modern life? If you love thought-provoking conversations and exchanging ideas with interesting people, this is the group for you!

Overthinkers of Eastern Queens is a monthly discussion group where we discuss engaging topics in a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. No need to venture into Manhattan, Williamsburg, or Astoria. We meet at a local bar right here in Queens, enjoying drinks and good company as we chat about everything from philosophy to psychology to pop culture.

Let’s overthink together! Come join us and turn your endless thoughts into good conversation.

This month's topic: Internet "brain rot"

Phone addiction, doom-scrolling, brain rot, constant mindless consumption of online content… How is it affecting us and why can’t we seem to stop? Let's Discuss!

Feel free to use the following articles to get some ideas about this topic (but don’t worry if you haven’t had time to read them, you’re welcome to join the discussion either way!)

Brain rot and the crisis of deep thought in the age of social media
The tyranny of brain rot

Event will begin with some reflection prompts as people settle in, mingle, and get drinks. Then we will get into our discussion! Come and overthink with us!

We will be at the big table by the front window. This is a free event but we strongly encourage a one-drink minimum (soft drinks count too!) in order to support our venue :)
