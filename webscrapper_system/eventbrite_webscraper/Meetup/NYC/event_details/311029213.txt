# Whether you are trying to go to the next level as a conference speaker, motivational speaker, comic, author, trainer, coach, or influencer, you will find resources to improve your speaking abilities with more in-depth evaluations and longer speaking times.
# If you are trying to build a business related to speaking and writing, you will also interact with a network that extends beyond the club and learn the tools to build your business.
# Members routinely look for opportunities outside the club to speak in professional, community, and performance venues.
# We are a supportive and information sharing group of members interested in building everyone's success.
