Our weekly meeting is a supportive place to practice your public speaking and leadership skills, no matter what level you're at. We also practice taking on meeting roles, club executive roles and dealing with all kinds of challenges. It is both a fun and educational experience!

Although the club is based at SickKids, all are welcome, and our meetings are currently online, via Zoom.
