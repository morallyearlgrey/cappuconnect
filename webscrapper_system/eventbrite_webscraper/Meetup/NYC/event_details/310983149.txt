Join us for an unforgettable night of speed dating, where you can meet up to 20 singles just like you in one FUN evening!

How it works?
We expect about 20 men and 20 women to attend our speed dating event. Each man and woman will have a three-minute mini date with one another. You will indicate who you liked on a "match card." If you are chosen by the same person, we will send you each other's contact information the next day!

Ages:
Women 30 - 45, Men 30 - 45

FAQs
Dress code? We recommend you dress to make a good first impression. No hats, sweats, t-shirts, hoodies or sneakers, jeans ok.

What time should I arrive? Please arrive at 7pm sharp to sign in and get situated.

Is this event private? The Rose will be private for our speed dating event.

Ticket price will go up as the date approaches. We cannot accept walk-ins because we need to ensure an equal number of men and women.

IMPORTANT:
Meetup is just one way we are promoting our event. We are selling tickets for this event throughout the web. The amount of RSVPs on our Meetup group does not reflect the actual total number of people attending.
