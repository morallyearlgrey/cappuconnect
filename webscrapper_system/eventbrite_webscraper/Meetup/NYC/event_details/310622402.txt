We're based in south central Pennsylvania. At this time we're mostly meeting online, but some of us who live near each other get together in person. For our next online Meetup on the fourth Wednesday of the month, 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm, you can participate either by webcam or telephone call. The link will be sent by early evening to everyone who has RSVPd, and we will check for late RSVPs by 6:00 pm that day.

We recommend that you RSVP from the Events page:

If you don't see the link in your Inbox by 6:00 pm that day, check your spam folder, or send a note directly to the organizer https://www.meetup.com/sci-and-sci-fi/members/?op=leaders

Feel free to bring up any aspect of science & society, or science fiction. Topics can include either: science and philosophy (natural sciences, social sciences, philosophy, philosophy of science, technology, science & society) or science fiction (movies, novels, TV shows, etc.). (Also, you might have suggestions for some upcoming group activities, such as going to a movie, museum, or other event, as a group. New members might want to tell a bit about their interests.
