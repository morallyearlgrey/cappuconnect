The “God of the Gaps” argument—claiming that God explains what science cannot—has long been criticized for shrinking as human knowledge expands. But what if there’s a more nuanced version of this argument? One not rooted in ignorance, but in the fundamental limits of human understanding itself.

Enter Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, which mathematically proves that within any consistent system of logic, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within that system. Does this open the door to a rational acknowledgment of mysteries that may remain permanently beyond human explanation—whether those mysteries point to God, the transcendent, or simply the limits of reason?

In this session, we’ll explore:

What Gödel’s theorems actually say—and don’t say—about the limits of human knowledge.
Whether the “God of the Gaps” argument, when reframed as an acknowledgment of intrinsic limits rather than temporary ignorance, holds any philosophical merit.
Alternative secular explanations for the unknown, such as human cognitive limits, multiverse theories, or epistemological humility.
How this question intersects with science, philosophy, and personal belief systems across the spectrum.

This conversation is for skeptics, believers, and anyone intrigued by the boundaries of what we can know. It’s less about proving or disproving God, and more about asking: When we reach the edges of knowledge, what—if anything—should we place there?
