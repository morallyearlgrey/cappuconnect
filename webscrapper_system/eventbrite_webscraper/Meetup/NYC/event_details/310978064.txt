Y'all, we've found a new home away from home!

Join fellow Texans and friends for a night of genuine Southern hospitality at Lucinda's in the East Village - the honky-tonk that brings a slice of Austin right to NYC.

When: Wednesday, October 15th, 6:00-9:00 PM
Where: Lucinda's, Avenue A at E. 11th Street (map)

This ain't just any bar - Lucinda's is owned by country legend Lucinda Williams herself and serves up everything we've been missing: a working jukebox spinning classic country, walls lined with photos of country music icons 🎸, affordable drinks 🍺, boiled peanuts 🥜, and enough cowboy boots 👢 to make you forget you're in Manhattan.

Whether you're craving some live country music, a casual shot of whiskey 🥃, or just want to swap stories with folks who understand why you still say "fixin' to," this is your spot.

Come as you are - boots optional but highly encouraged!
