Please note, we are going to the 54th St Hells Kitchen location, not the 44th St Theatre District location! Will be trying their $25 (3) course lunch prix fixe, but feel free to order from full menu if you wish.

The food quality at Bocca di Bacco is actually very good. On the menu is an extensive offering of Italian small plates, pastas, and tasty full sized entrees to accompany all the wines that pour from a giant wine keggerator behind the bar.

This meal will be 3 course prix fixe, drinks will be separate. Estimate $33 per person (tax & tip included).

Please bring cash or have a Venmo/Zelle account. Will contact rsvps 3 days before the event to confirm. Hope to see you there!
