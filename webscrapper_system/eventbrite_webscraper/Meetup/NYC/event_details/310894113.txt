Join the Manhattan Women's Social Meetup for a fun and casual lunch at Sea Salt (Greek/Mediterranean restaurant).

I understand that the date falls within the Rosh Hashanah holiday and I don't mean to offend anyone. The restaurant manager agreed to let me have 30 people at the restaurant (with no hassle) but only on 9/24 (probably because he knows business will be low that day).

I have eaten there once before and found it to be a cute little place with good food and asked the manager then and there if I could bring a large group.

I hope to see you on the 24th! I will be asking for your cell phone numbers as part of the RSVP. Please know that only you and I will be able to see them. You will notice that you can't see anyone else's number.

Thank you,
Laura Schindelman
