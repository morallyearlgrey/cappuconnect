Dr. Liam Ryan will lead the meeting.

So-called artificial intelligence is ubiquitous, as are the philosophical questions it raises: What exactly is AI? What do we mean by terms such as `artificial' and `intelligence'? Is AI truly intelligent? As AI grows more powerful and humanity ever more dependent upon it, the number of questions will only continue to grow: Should we trust AI? Should AI be destroyed before it is too late? Can AI ever be a moral agent? How does AI relate to free will? What rights to privacy do we have? What is the purpose of work and education? Leave you chatbots at home and join us for a face-to-face, human discussion about the frontiers of AI through a philosophical lens, considering the above issues and more.
