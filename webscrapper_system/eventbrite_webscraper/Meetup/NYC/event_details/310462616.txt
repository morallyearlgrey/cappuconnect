The 2nd Annual Dublin KM Summit happened this year. The organizing committee is here to discuss how it went and their plans for next year. This conference is quickly becoming the "can't miss" KM event of the year, so don't miss your chance to hear about it, and even contribute to the planning during this knowledge cafe.

As always, the event is free and virtual. We'll follow the Gurteen Knowledge Cafe format, which means a provocation for 15 minutes, then 3 rounds of small group discussions about the provocation, then a full group discussion to close the event.

See you there!
