IN-PERSON MEETINGS HAVE RESUMED! We are conducting Hybrid Virtual/In-Person meetings now. We would love to see you in person or via ZOOM. Message us in advance to get the Zoom ID.

Would you like to give more polished presentations? Be able to network more effectively? Feel comfortable talking in front of groups? We can help you become a more accomplished and confident speaker.

Blue Frog Toastmasters is made up of individuals from different professional backgrounds. We get together to improve our public speaking and leadership skills on a weekly basis.
It's fun group of people who are committed to helping each other grow their public speaking, general communication and leadership skills.

A typical meeting consists of prepared speeches, impromptu 'off-the-cuff' speaking, and evaluations all given in a creative and fun environment.

Regardless of whether you're starting off with little to no experience in public speaking, or you're a more experienced speaker, come along to one of our meetings and check us out. Visitors are welcome, no special invitation required! If attending online, message in advance for Zoom ID. We start promptly at 7:30 so please come (or join via Zoom) early.

Our club promotes leadership and public speaking skills through practice and participation. All members need to have a very high proficiency in spoken English.

We are located at 10221 Ella Lee Lane, Houston, 77042, Room MT-104 at Grace Presbyterian Church (The church has been gracious and allowed us to use their room, however we do not have an affiliation with the church).

We cannot wait to Meet You!
