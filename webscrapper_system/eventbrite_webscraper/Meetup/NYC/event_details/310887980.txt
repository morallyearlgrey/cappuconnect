Tired of doing everything alone? Looking to meet new girlfriends in NYC?
Instead of big mixers, weâ€™re keeping it intimate: We match you in curated groups of 4, matched by vibe & interests. ðŸ’•

âœ¨ How it works:

RSVP + pay the $10 commitment fee (to keep everyone accountable).
Fill our short intake form (2 mins) until Sunday the week before the event.

By Tuesday, same week of the event, youâ€™ll receive your group of 4 + suggested venues.
Meet your group on Thursday, at 19:00.

Each group is responsible for making their own reservation at suggested venues or pick their own venues.

ðŸ’¡ Why a fee? To make sure everyone shows up! Think of it as buying accountability + 3 new connections.

RSVP only if you can join this date.

Looking so much forward to bringing you together.
