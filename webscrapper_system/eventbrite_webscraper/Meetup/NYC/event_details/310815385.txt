Watch the inserted interview (see below).

Then, join us for an in-depth conversation and guided discussion centered on the inserted (see below) interview with Stanislav Grof, a pioneering figure in transpersonal psychology and psychedelic research. Grof’s work bridges modern psychotherapy with ancient spiritual traditions, exploring non-ordinary states of consciousness, holotropic breathwork, and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.
We'll reflect on key themes from the interview, including his approach to expanded states of awareness, the perinatal unconscious, and his challenges to mainstream psychiatry.

NOTE: This meet-up will help us prepare for a deeper reading assignment (Healing Our Deepest Wounds, by Stan Grof) on Grof's approach to Psyche (see next meetup).

No prior reading required—just bring your curiosity and regard to others!

Here's the interview: PLEASE WATCH IT !!
