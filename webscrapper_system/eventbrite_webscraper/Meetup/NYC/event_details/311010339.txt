Looking to meet new people, share experiences, and explore the world of dating and romance in a fun, stress-free way? This seminar event is for you!

We’ll cover topics like:

- Building confidence in dating
- How to communicate honestly and openly
- Overcoming nerves and past challenges
- Creating genuine connections

This is a friendly, supportive space where you can learn, and meet others who are also navigating dating and relationships. Whether you’re just getting back out there or already dating, you’ll walk away with new insights and maybe even new friends.

Bring your questions, stories, and an open heart—this is about connection and growth.
