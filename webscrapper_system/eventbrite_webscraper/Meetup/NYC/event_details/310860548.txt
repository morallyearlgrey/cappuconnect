Do you freeze up at the thought of speaking in front of a group? Want to feel more confident and persuasive in meetings, presentations, and everyday conversations?

Visit our dynamic and supportive online public speaking club!

We meet every Friday at Noon EST for a one-hour session packed with fun, learning, and growth. Our club isn't about rigid rules or boring lectures. It's about giving you a space to practice, experiment, and get real-time, constructive feedback on your speeches. You'll learn to:

Craft compelling stories and messages.
Conquer your nerves and speak with confidence.
Engage any audience, no matter the size.

Our members are from all walks of life, and our meetings are filled with laughter and camaraderie. We believe that becoming a great speaker should be an enjoyable journey, not a chore.

We are the 3Talkers Toastmasters Club and are based in the Hudson, Massachusetts area. Anyone interested in improving their public speaking is welcome to attend as a guest.

Ready to take the next step toward becoming a more confident, articulate, and influential version of yourself?
