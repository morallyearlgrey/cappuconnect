Humanity’s ability to solve problems has always depended on how we think, share, and refine ideas together. But for most of history, this process has unfolded unconsciously. Through trial and error, moments of brilliance, and slow progress shaped more by chance than intention.

What if we could change that?

This series explores how we can become more aware of the way we think and collaborate. We aim to transform insight from something we stumble upon to something we intentionally cultivate. As we face overlapping global challenges ecological, technological, social, and spiritual we need new ways of integrating knowledge and generating solutions at scale.

Hosted by 52LivingIdeas and the Greater Philadelphia Thinking Society, Hunter Glenn will lead a Comprehensivist Wednesday one discussion on metamodernism every month. This ongoing series is an open invitation to thinkers, seekers, designers, and anyone curious about the journey from fragmentation to coherence—and from crisis to transformation.

Come help shape the next phase of human thinking. Let it be by design rather than by accident.

Hunter will lead a discussion on Metamodernism on the third Wednesday of each month.

Welcome to the series "Comprehensivist Wednesdays." Transdisciplinarity, Renaissance humanism, homo universalis, and Polymathy are some of the ways of describing this approach, which Buckminster Fuller called Comprehensivity and described as “macro-comprehensive and micro-incisive.”
