Important note: Time change and new zoom link.

Want to socialize with other vegans or vegetarians on your lunch break?
Every Thursday at 1 pm est!

The Online Vegan Lunch Club is a comfortable space for new and longtime vegetarians and vegans to chat and hang out.
Come for a part of the hour, or the whole thing! You bring lunch and we'll provide the company.

We have switched to a new zoom account and are confident that this will be permanent. We have also changed our meeting time to 1 pm est.

Hopefully this won't pose a problem for people wanting to join us.
To find the new link, go to dhuc (https://donheights.ca/) and click on "zoom" at the top of the page. (This will show up as Don Heights Unitarian... Just click on the zoom button.)
