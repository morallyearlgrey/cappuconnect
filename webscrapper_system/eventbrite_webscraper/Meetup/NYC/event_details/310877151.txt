Thinking of going solo, consulting, freelancing, or creating something of your own?

This short, casual meetup is for solopreneurs (or solopreneur-curious folks) who want to start smart. We'll walk through the free Baseline Builder, a short guide tool to help you:

Figure out what you really need to earn
Explore income models that fit how you want to work
Prioritize your spending (and ditch the fluff)

Then weâ€™ll open up the floor:

Share what youâ€™re working on,
Whatâ€™s feeling stuck,
What kind of support you could use.

This is not a pitch-fest or sales call. Itâ€™s real talk for people who want to build a solo business. This event is limited to 10 attendees to keep the conversation real and useful.
