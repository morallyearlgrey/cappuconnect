Welcome to Geographically Speaking!

We are Club #3660.

NGA and predecessor agencies have hosted our club since before we chartered on October 30, 1963.

We are celebrating our 60th anniversary with several events. If you would like to be a guest speaker, please contact us.

Our club is open for membership to personnel affiliated with our host agency. If you work at National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), please visit us on the first and third Thursday of the month. We hold special events on the fifth Thursday.

We invite guests to become members. We hope you will join our club! We also steer guests to other clubs, if our club is not a good fit.

For more information, or to request to visit us, please use the "Contact Us" tool in the Main Menu of our club website - here - https://3660.toastmastersclubs.org/

You can find a membership application form under "Public Downloads" on our Main Page tab.

We run our meetings via MS Teams now.
