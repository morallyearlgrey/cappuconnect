***Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be hosting our 3rd Sunday Meetup for Conversations online virtually via Zoom.com until further notice.

This event is free for you, your guests and Meetup members. Donations are greatly appreciated.

Please register in advance for our 1:00pm Online Meetup via Zoom.
For the last 20+ years, we co-organized in-person Meetups every 3rd Sunday. We have created opportunities for many people in the greater Washington DC area to make new contacts and extend joy, friendship and prosperity. We have enjoyed many conversations over lunch and worked together on many exciting community projects with many people from diverse backgrounds.

We look forward to providing you with opportunities to network, to make new contacts, and to explore the possibility of working together harmoniously to achieve extraordinary results. Let’s come together, learn together, and succeed together!
