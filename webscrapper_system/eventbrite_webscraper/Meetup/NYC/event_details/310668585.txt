********************************************
Letâ€™s traverse a number of amusing concepts; horror scope ; the amalgamation of the water and the earth. A game of hot potatoes with the moon ! And...!
Can you sing? Or.. whisper a song you donâ€™t even know the words to? I can and will !
Maybe you can run your anxiety ridden fingers on the trembling strings of a violin, a guitar..!
Or.. maybe you feel a need to engage us in a sensationally beguiling confabulation! Bring it on!
And If none of the above is of your desire to partake in, come light to meet and mingle!
This is an evening of fun and friendly get together and light conversations! :)
