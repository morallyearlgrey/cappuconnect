Socrates Café is a philosophical discussion group that meets monthly, September through April, on Zoom. The topic for discussion will be chosen by the participants. We encourage participants to have their cameras on to improve the discussion experience for all.

Socrates Café is a movement to bring philosophy outside the academic setting. It started in Montclair, NJ, to help those of us who are not professional philosophers develop our critical thinking skills by interacting respectfully and actively with others who share a love of ideas. There are hundreds of Socrates Cafes across the US, in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

This is a program of the Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County, which has a variety of interesting programs and presentations.
