G's has outrageously good sandwiches in various creative combinations. It's a very casual-looking place but the food is serious. Please do NOT sign up if you are avoiding red meat, calories, fats or carbs! Expect gut bomb deliciousness for around $30/pp w/tax, tip, & fee.

Some likely choices:

Truffle Wiz Wit Steak - fried onions, cherry pepper mayo, Cooper sharp, and black truffle wiz, on a seeded roll
Prime Rib Steak - portobello brown gravy marsala sauce w/melted provolone
Long Hot Steak - topped w/diced long hots, crumbled sweet sausage, fried red onions, & Cooper sharp cheese
Vodka Burrata Cutlet
Chicken Bacon Ranch
French fries, plain or truffled

I intend to order maybe one sandwich per person, to slice up and share flavors, plus some fries for the table. If you still have any room after that, bless you! Desserts & drinks will be on a separate bill split by those who order them. Also, Laboratorio del Gelato is nearby if you want to go for gelato or sorbet afterwards.
