Do you have a question about SQL Server or the data platform space? Are you running into technical problems in the office and want a second opinion? Do you have an urge to stump our panel with arcane or weird scenarios--or watch others do just that to us? Then Shop Talk is for you.

Shop Talk is a Q&A-driven broadcast featuring Mala Mahadevan, Tracy Boggiano, Mike Chrestensen, and Kevin Feasel. Each week, we will dedicate one hour to answering your questions, including live questions with no prep (and I can't see how that could possibly go wrong!). Send questions to us on the air at https://www.twitch.tv/trianglessug or get them to us early by e-mailing shoptalk@tripass.org and give us a fighting chance to come up with the right answer.

Prior episodes' show notes are available at https://shoptalk.tripass.org .
