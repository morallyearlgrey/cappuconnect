Session Description:

We consider how excessive self-consciousness can become both a form of insight and a trap.

###### "Notes from Underground" by Fyodor Dostoevsky

Dostoevsky's underground man is a character tormented by his own hyper-consciousness, unable to act spontaneously because he analyzes every thought and motive. His endless self-reflection leads to paralysis, spite, and isolation rather than wisdom or peace. The story explores how intellectual sophistication can become a prison that separates us from natural human connection and authentic action.

The underground man embodies the dark side of excessive thinking and self-awareness. Dostoevsky asks: Can consciousness become a curse rather than a gift? What happens when self-analysis replaces genuine engagement with life and other people?
