Let's meet and connect over some karaoke ...
Please support the venue by buying drinks (alcohol and non-alcohol)
The venue has daily Happy Hour deals till 8 pm!
Songs tend to be free, till 8 p.m. too. After 8 pm, the songs are $2 (cash).

They have an ATM machine in the venue, and you get a discount on drinks when you use cash.

If you don't sing, come and provide morale support to those who do.
Most importantly, tip your bartenders!
Since the event in the early evening, the venue tends to be less crowded quite often.

Write it down your name and the number of the song on a post-it and hand it to bartender (with a smile of course)
Sing like a rock star ðŸŽ¤ when you are called
