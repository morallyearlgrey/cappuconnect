What if a nonprofit could scale like a startup, measure like an investor, and still lead with humanity?

Kerry Brodieâ€™s journey from public policy to founding Emmaâ€™s Torch is a masterclass in modern, mission-driven entrepreneurship. She took a simple idea â€” using food to empower refugees â€” and built it into a data-informed, multi-city enterprise by applying a founder's mindset to a social cause.

This isnâ€™t just a fireside chat; itâ€™s a deep dive into the strategic choices that allowed Kerry to grow from a small pop-up to a successful, repeatable model.Â 

If you're building a business with a mission, this is the playbook you need to learn.

What You'll Learn

Scaling the Mission: How to grow from one location to multiple cities and a new, custom-built campus without losing the core community and support that made the first cafÃ© work.
The Nonprofit-as-Startup Playbook: The lessons learned from running a social enterprise with the agility of a startupÂ â€” balancing fundraising, earned revenue, and a scrappy growth mindset.
Measuring What Matters: How to build an impact framework that captures both financial ROI and human transformation, moving beyond simple metrics to prove long-term value.

Madison Simon,

I've spent the past 8 years working closely with startups in revenue-focused roles, and I genuinely love being in the trenches with bold, compassionate founders tackling real-world problems. There's nothing more energizing than teaming up with people who think differently, move fast, and build with heart. I believe being genuine, knowledgeable, and deliberate in business relationships is essential.
