This is an invitation-only event!

It's open to anyone who has attended a prior event. Just shoot me an email or Discord message and remind me when you were here. I think they moved the waiting list to Pro, otherwise do that as well. We have exactly 15 comfy seats so don't take one unless you're definitely coming.

Colossus: The Forbin Project may be showing its age in a number of ways, but in some important ones it's more apropos than ever. Come by and watch in our comfy screening room. Popcorn will be served. Afterwards, we'll have a discussion about the movie and AGI.
