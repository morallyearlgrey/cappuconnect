Thanks to our partners at Startup Grind and Scout for putting on this exciting learning session!

The world of grants can feel like a black box: complex rules, competitive proposals, and a maze of acronyms. In this webinar, we break it all down. You'll learn how to find the right opportunities, what funders are really looking for this and next year, and how to craft a competitive proposal. Whether your brand new to grants or looking to refine your approach, we'll give you practical tips and insider knowledge to make the process less intimidating and a lot more effective.
