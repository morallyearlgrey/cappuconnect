How do you turn product thinking into a mindset that shapes every team?

In this TPG Live roundtable, we‚Äôll explore what it takes to build a product-led organization, where teams across the business are aligned around user value, not just deliverables. From reshaping incentives to influencing executive priorities, product leaders often have to drive culture change far beyond their own teams. We‚Äôll dive into strategies for shifting mindsets, redefining success metrics, and embedding product thinking into how decisions are made across the company.

We‚Äôll also dig into the frontline challenge of cross-functional collaboration, with a focus on the dynamic between design and engineering. When intent is unclear or trust breaks down, velocity suffers. We‚Äôll discuss how product managers can act as connective tissue between disciplines, clarify purpose, and make space for both creativity and execution. Learn how to lead through the friction, align around outcomes, and keep the user at the center.

What does it take to make a company truly product-led without adding more process?
How do you get design and engineering to move together when everything feels like a trade-off?

This session brings together practical advice and hard-won insights from product leaders who have pushed for change in complex environments. Whether you‚Äôre trying to elevate your company‚Äôs product mindset or build better team collaboration, you‚Äôll leave with strategies you can use right away.
