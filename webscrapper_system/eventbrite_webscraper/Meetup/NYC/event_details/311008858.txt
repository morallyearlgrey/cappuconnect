Join us for an evening of Stoic philosophy and discussion. We'll kick off the event with a short presentation exploring one of the core ideas of Stoicism, focusing on its real-world application with some practices drawn from the texts. Following the presentation, we'll break into smaller groups for a lightly-facilitated discussion about the topic.

This week, we’ll be discussing what the Stoics believed and how they acted, the cardinal virtues, tranquility of mind, the Stoic Sage, and role of mindfulness in Stoicism. We’ll also be going over three practices; one from Seneca, one Epictetus, and one from a different-but-complementary philosophical tradition.

Thanks so much for your interest, and please remember:

"There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbor, if you would live for yourself." - Seneca, Letters from a Stoic, Letter 48
