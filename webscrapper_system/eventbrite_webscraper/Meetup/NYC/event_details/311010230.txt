Please join us for a night of PostgreSQL!

PostgreSQL is awesome - and out of the box performance could certainly be customized! In this talk, we’ll dig into the key fundamentals for PostgreSQL performance.

We’ll approach this from two angles - first memory cache and data management. There are a couple tricks for getting the most out of PostgreSQL memory without throwing more RAM (and money) at the problem. Second, we’ll look at PostgreSQL’s internal EXPLAIN tools to diagnose issues with queries, test improvements, and make your queries faster. You’ll leave this talk with a better grasp on what helps PostgreSQL perform and how to get started on your own performance improvements.
