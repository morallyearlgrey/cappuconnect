Welcome to the Mobile App Meetup! 🎉

This month’s session will be a chance to connect as a community, share our stories, and set the stage for what’s to come. While we’re lining up future guest speakers, this kickoff event will be focused on you—the founders, builders, and innovators in the room.

We’ll talk about the challenges of building and scaling mobile apps, swap experiences, and brainstorm together. If you’ve ever thought, “I wish I had someone to compare notes with about my app journey,” this is the space for it.

And—if you’ve got a story, lesson, or strategy you’d like to share with the group in a future session, we’d love to hear from you. This community is about learning from each other, and your voice matters.
