Mokyo, a cozy nook in the heart of the East Village, is the sister restaurant to Thursday Kitchen. At both places, Chef Kyungmin Hyun’s frequent strategy is to rewire familiar dishes; when a dish isn’t already Korean, she adds a component that is. Each of them involve ingredients you wouldn't typically find mingling together, like truffle salsa verde or pork jowl with kabayaki butter.

This meal will be family style, drinks will be separate. Estimate ~$47-52 per person (tax & tip included).
