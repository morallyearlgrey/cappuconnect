Canâ€™t sleep?
Wondering what others talk about and youâ€™re not ?!

The global gossip?
Undiscovered thoughts unraveled only when the rest fall asleep?!
Falling on the path of another ambiguous beingthat could entertain your every cell of enthusiastic curiosity?

* Worried if you fit in ? Thinking youâ€™re not a philosopher?
Worry not!
We engage in lifeâ€™s matters in productive comprehensive ways suitable for almost all curious.
If you enjoy analytical philosophy, you may join a breakout room with .. the other birds.. of a feather!

You are one of us if you breath, think, eat and .. talk ! .. and then talk some moreâ€¦
Philosophy is the oxygen for our concerned and concerning.. mindsâ€¦.
