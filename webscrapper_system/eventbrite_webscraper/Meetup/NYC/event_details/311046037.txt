The Lounge loves to present different approaches and aspects of complexity science, and we are delighted to welcome Professor Christopher Mowles.

Chris will give a brief history of his research community, the Complexity and Management Centre at the University of Hertfordshire, which has been going for 25 years, working with a radical interpretation of the complexity sciences. He will briefly explain the key ideas of the perspective of perspectives called complex responsive processes of relating, which adopts a non-teleological view of change. That is to say that there may be things we aspire to, but even our aspirations will evolve and change in our interactions with each other and the world. To take the implications from the complexity sciences seriously means treating the future as radically open and impervious to our grids and frameworks. He will go on to explore what all of this might mean for practice in the increasingly dark times we face, a practice he has begun to think of as hopeful pessimism.
