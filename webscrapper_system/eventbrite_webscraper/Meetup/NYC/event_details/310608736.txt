The Humanist Association of Toronto Presents
http://www.humanisttoronto.ca/

Are you seeking a friendly, open-minded environment where you can chat about moving away from religious beliefs and doctrines?

Our Toronto monthly meet-up discusses past and present religious issues and looks at a positive life free of guilt, fear and shame-your new consciousness; beyond believing.

While the group is still dedicated to dealing with issues and questions revolving around religion and life-long impacts of spiritual/supernatural beliefs, it is also a place for those interested in exploring larger issues in a non-judgmental welcoming atmosphere.

It's a place for people to share their desire to throw away the burden of religious indoctrination and antiquated dogma.

Whether you are thinking of leaving your religion or are already living religion free, or you just wish to support others in this quest, join us.

We meet on the second Monday of each month at 7:00 pm.
