**This is a beginner level lesson - see what we will draw and color in the event chat area below** I slow down the videos for any that go too fast.

Ready to learn how to draw? Get your paper, markers or colored pencils and get ready to do some drawing all together! We will sit and learn to draw following some fun learn to draw videos.

**We will color our pictures as well - please bring something to color with! :) )

Suggested supplies needed for event:

1. Pencil - sometimes the instructor has us draw lines that need to be erased later, so you may want a pencil or erasable pen (optional)

2. Crayons, colored pencils, or markers - to color in your photo! (optional)

3. Ruler (to draw straight lines if you want) (optional)

4. Something to trace to make a circle (optional)

I use the following sites for our instruction: https://www.artforkidshub.com/

I ask for input on what attendees want to draw, so feel free to let me know if there is something you like!

Guidelines
1. Be kind to all
2. No activists
3. Avoid discussing politics, religion, and the environment
4. Use professional language

Note: This is a very SIMPLE drawing class - made for anyone at any level - but mostly beginners or people learning to draw!

Note from Staci:
Here are some things to remember - my events are simple and virtual. So what does that mean? It means that the event is what you make it. We play games, we draw. It's either your thing or it's not. It's all good! I hope you will come with your good attitude, smile, and willingness to socialize with others. When you give event feedback, remember to consider every event is different and it's all about what you bring to the event! You will enjoy it based on the energy you put into it. (I can only do so much) Have a question about one of my events? Feel free to reach out to me! Thanks all! - S.
