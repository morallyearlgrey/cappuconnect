The Warren astronomical Society meets on the first Monday of the month in the auditorium of the Cranbrook Institute of Science. At the meetings, we spend the first hour or so of the meeting on club business and observing reports, then have two presentations, one short and one full-length.
Main Talk:
Coming soon!
Short Talk:
Also coming soon!

***

If you would like to present either a short talk (10-15 minutes) or a full-length talk (45-60 minutes) at a future meeting, please email Dale Partin at firstvp@warrenastro.org.

The views expressed in presentations are those of the speakers and do not necessarily represent, and should not be attributed to, the Warren Astronomical Society.
