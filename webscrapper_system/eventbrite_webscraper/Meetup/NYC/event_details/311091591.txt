Do you love trivia? Are you looking to meet some new friends? Are you looking for that special someone? Well come on out to this fun new event in NYC! It's a singles trivia night from 7:00 - 9:00 PM every other Thursday.
You will be playing a variety of trivia games. When you arrive we will put you on a team. Teams will be mixed genders and we will rotate teams each round (so all girls meet all guys there; you will rotate with your wingmen/ wingwomen which is a great way to meet new friends as well).

We expect about 80% of people to come on their own so it's the perfect event to come to by yourself but also feel free to come with a friend or 2.

You'll answer fun trivia questions in all of your favorite categories like pop culture, history, entertainment (music, movies & TV), arts & literature, science and more. You'll be working with your group to come up with answers and never put "on the spot" having to answer anything by yourself so it's low pressure and lots of fun!

The winning group will win 50% off their next trivia night (your scores will be added from each round). and the 2nd place team will win 25% off their next trivia night.

* We give everyone "connect cards" at the beginning of the event. You can write your name and email address on the cards and hand them out throughout the night so people you meet can easily stay in touch with with you if they'd like to.
