[Cross-posted from NYC Stoics]

There's little doubt that many of the ancient Stoics connected their ethics to their worldview. However, many modern Stoics disagree with much of ancient Stoic physics. Additionally, how deeply connected their physics were to their ethics is open to question.

So, how deeply dependent is Stoic ethics on the Stoic worldview? How much of ancient Stoic worldview must modern practitioners accept in order to practice Stoicism coherently? And what does this mean for how modern practitioners should approach Stoicism?

At this meetup, we'll explore these questions by discussing Christopher Gill's paper on the topic entitled "Stoic Ethical Theory: How Much is Enough?"

To prepare for the meetup, please read the paper in full and come prepared with questions or concepts you want to discuss. It is available for free here.

We'll be assuming you did the reading at this meetup, so if you didn't, it's likely you'll be left behind!
