DON'T BE SHY, GIVE US A TRY! GUESTS ARE MOST WELCOME!

Come out and visit Inclusive Toastmasters Club!

We provide a supportive, positive and fun learning experience where members are empowered to develop both their public speaking and leadership skills.

You will gain greater self-confidence. You will also grow both personally and professionally. Plus, you will establish new friendships.

The club meets on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month.

We were meeting at the Bayview Hill Community Centre in Richmond Hill, ON Canada.

We currently meet online. For a meeting link, contact the host, Jacqueline.
