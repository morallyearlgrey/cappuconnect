Ready to take the next step in your career? Join us for PSE Professional Exchange: Networking + Career Success — a biweekly event where authentic networking meets hands-on career guidance.
This isn’t just another mixer. We’ll walk through the PSE Job Success Rubrics (Resume, LinkedIn, and Interview) — practical one-pagers that cut through the noise and help you stand out from the competition. You’ll also gain insights on:

Making your resume the “first impression” that gets noticed
Optimizing LinkedIn so recruiters find you
Interviewing like a pro and positioning yourself as the solution

Along the way, you’ll connect with peers, exchange feedback, and grow your network in a supportive, no-pressure environment. Whether you’re job hunting now or just planning ahead, this is your space to build skills, share insights, and leave with actionable takeaways.
What to Expect:

Career-focused networking with professionals across industries
Walkthrough of the PSE Rubrics (free handouts provided)
Tips on resumes, LinkedIn, interviewing, and job search strategy
Optional peer feedback + light mock interview practice
A collaborative, growth-focused atmosphere

Bring your questions, your experiences, and your curiosity. Let’s grow together and help each other succeed.
