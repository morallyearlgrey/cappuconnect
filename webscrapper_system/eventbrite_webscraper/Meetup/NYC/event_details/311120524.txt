### 🚉 Morning Meet-up & Travel Plan

We’ll meet at McDonald’s from 10:00 AM to 10:20 AM (right across from Grand Central Terminal).
From there, we’ll walk over to Grand Central and take the Metro-North Railroad to Purdy's Station.
At Purdy’s, we’ll take Ubers or cabs in groups of 3–4 people each the rest of the way to the farm (about 10 minutes).
We’ll do the same for the trip back — split Ubers/cabs from the farm back to Purdy’s Station, then return by train to Grand Central.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

Only come if you’re comfortable being responsible for your own travel either this way or on your own.
Once we’re on the farm, it’s basically impossible to find us if you’re late — come at your own risk.
I’ll have my GPS on if you really want to try to find us, but it’s much easier to stay with the group.
Expect a fun fall day full of apples, beautiful scenery, and great memories 🍂📸

🍎 Bring good walking shoes, a smile, and get ready to pick some apples — Wepa! 🎉
