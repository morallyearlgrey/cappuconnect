Step into the delicate world of flowering teas—rare botanical infusions that bloom before your eyes, inviting you to slow down and savor each unfolding moment.

Held in an intimate tea ceremony space tucked away in Flatiron, this immersive experience offers a quiet retreat in the heart of NYC.

Taste five exquisite flowering teas, each rooted in ancient Eastern wellness traditions and thoughtfully selected to awaken the senses and soothe the mind.

Enjoy light seasonal snacks, carefully paired to complement the subtle, layered flavor of each infusion.

Participate in a grounding, heart-opening ritual, reconnecting you with your body, breath, and inner calm.

Whether you're new to flower teas or a devoted sipper, this is your invitation to reconnect, reset, and bloom—from the inside out.
