At this event you will be going on a series of about 10 to 15 mini dates with each date lasting about 5 minutes each. Women stay seated and the men rotate from table to table until they meet each woman.
You will get a match card and at the end of each mini-date you'll indicate whether or not you'd like to see the person again. At the end of the evening you will hand your match card in to the event host. If you both select each other, we will send you each others' email address the next day so you can set up a future date! Within 48hrs, you'll receive an email with the first name and email of your mutual matches. We do not give out names or contact info unless there is a mutual match.
Our Speed Dating events tend to attract quality, single professionals who are done with the dating games and ready to meet that special someone. Most people know within a few minutes if they would like to see someone again.
We will have fun, ice breaker questions available to pull out of an envelope on the tables so there will never be a lull in conversation. The questions are also a great way to gauge chemistry with the other person.
