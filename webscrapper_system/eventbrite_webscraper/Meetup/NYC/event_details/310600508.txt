There's a shift happening: engineers who talk to users, own outcomes, and ship products people actually want. They're called product engineers, and they're building the products that win. Here's the uncomfortable truth: Most developers spend their time optimizing for technical perfection while users abandon their products. Meanwhile, a new breed of engineer is emerging—one that ships fast, talks to customers, and aims to actually move the needle.
Who this event is for:

Product managers working closely with engineering teams
Software developers who want to own products, not just features
Technical founders building their first product
Engineering leaders focused on user outcomes

What you’ll walk away with:

Why "customer obsession" beats "clean code" every single time
How companies are rewriting engineering culture around user impact
How to identify what products people actually want
The playbook for shipping fast without breaking everything

Technical perfection versus user obsession. Most successful products need both. Join us to learn how leading software companies in Jersey City are accomplishing this.
