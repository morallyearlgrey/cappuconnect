❓ Frequently Asked Questions ❓

I won't be available immediately, can I show up later? We’re flexible about the time you show up. If you plan to arrive 1 hour or more late, check for directions on the front door or in the event comments section.
Can I bring a guest? Of course - be sure to have them RSVP so we can accommodate seating and food!
Do I need a laptop? Ideally, but not mandatory. The primary focus is on building community and connections amongst the Sonar community. Hence why we emphasize socializing and connection. You'll have a great time regardless!
I'm new to coding, is this a good place to start? Of course! Sonar is a language agnostic tool thatf helps you code better in the age of AI. Although some words may sound scary, we strive to create a friendly environment for all skill levels and backgrounds.
