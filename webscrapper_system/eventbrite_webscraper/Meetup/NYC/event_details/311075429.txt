** Directions to George Mason Regional Library are below **

The Washington DC chapter of ACM SIGGRAPH invites you to join us in-person or virtually for our next Show and Tell/Social at the George Mason Regional Library. Meet the Washington DC Chapter in-person and, if desired, share a project you are working. We can provide feedback, if desired, or provide helpful advice should you be stuck. Almost any topic is open for discussion. This is a new venue for us so it should be an adventure.

The meeting will be hosted at George Mason Regional Library and on the Zoom platform. A link to the meeting will be provided 5 minutes prior to the presentation to all those who have responded to the announcement on our MeetUp. The link will also be visible to those who RSVP. Those who do not RSVP to the MeetUp announcement will not receive the link to the meeting.

The Zoom client may need to be downloaded to connect to the meeting. Safelinks Protection, used by some email applications, may alter the link. Please contact us if you have issues accessing the meeting.

Please join us on Wednesday, September 24, 2025 from 6:30pm to 8:30pm EDT at the George Mason Regional Library, or online, to learn new techniques and to meet the chapter members.
