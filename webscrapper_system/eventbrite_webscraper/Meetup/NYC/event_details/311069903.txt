Networking isn’t always easy. Some people love it, others dread it — and most of us wonder if we’re really doing it right. In this interactive session, we’ll explore how people network today, the challenges we face, and the small wins that keep us going.

We’ll share stories, swap tips, and talk openly about what makes networking hard: breaking the ice, following up, or just finding the right people. Then, we’ll take a peek at how AI tools are starting to support networking — from smarter introductions to personalized conversation starters.
No AI knowledge needed — this is about learning together.

We’ll finish with a **guided networking session powered by Intrro.ai**, so you leave with both fresh insights and real connections.
