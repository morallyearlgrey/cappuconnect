â€¢ What we'll do:
This event is both in person and online. For in person, we will meet at the Wesleyan R.J. Julia Bookstore on the lower level. The address for the bookstore is 413 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457.
For online, Zoom will be used. The Zoom link can be seen when you RSVP. If you haven't used Zoom before, just click on the link and follow the prompts to join the meeting. If the link isn't clickable for you, paste it in your search bar and go to it from there.
For the meeting, every attendee can choose to contribute one question as they arrive. The group will then vote on which questions to discuss for the evening. Audio will be set up so all online attendees can hear all in-person attendees, and vice versa. It will be one group discussion.
