Join us for Gongfu Sunday at the New York Tea Society!

Whether you’re a tea enthusiast or just starting to explore the world of tea, this is the perfect opportunity to learn more about tea culture and experiment with different brewing methods.

We’ll compare different waters, temperatures, vessels, cultivars, picking seasons, and harvest regions to broaden our knowledge and deepen our appreciation of tea.

Let’s have fun while learning together.
