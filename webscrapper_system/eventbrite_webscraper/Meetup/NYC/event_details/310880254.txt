In-Person Open House at Fat Cat Fab Lab!

Open House and Project Night:

Open House is casual and unstructured, come hang!
Get a tour of the space: Laser room, woodshop, metal shop, sewing area, 3D printing area, electronics lab, and more!
If you're looking for help with a project, stop by and meet members who may be able to help you with that cool new project you're totally stuck on!
If you're a non-member, this day is for you. You're welcome to use our space and hand tools to work on your projects! (Note: 3D printers available if your print completes during the meetup. Sorry, laser and CNC router reserved for members or those who've taken a class.)
If you're interested in joining as a Fat Cat Fab Lab member, in person participation at one of our Open House events is the first step towards becoming a member!

See you there!
