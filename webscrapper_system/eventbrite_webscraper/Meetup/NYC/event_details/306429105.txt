This is a free event and only heavy rain can stop us!

Dear verticals, it's time for a new hike in the Hudson Valley!
This time we will take a walk through the beautiful Tarrytown Lakes Park and Rockefeller State Park.
As always, we will pass through lakes, old churches, rivers and enjoy the beauty of the Hudson River.
We will stop for lunch at Pocantico Hills and come back home from Scarborough.
If we have enough time we will have dinner together.
This is not a loop hike!
