Find out why your past bad experiences have so much power to affect you, and how to overcome them.

The emotional pain from past bad experiences easily lingers in the present, making it hard to enjoy life and create your future.

Even when you think you've moved on, the negative emotions can be triggered, sending you back into the pain of that experience.

Emotions such as grief, depression, anxiety, fear (or terror), boiling anger, simmering resentment, feelings of shame, blaming and regret
can leave you incapacitated to a greater or lesser degree.

In this event, we will be discussing the reasons why these past bad experiences have the power to affect you long after.

We'll also discuss some simple solutions to overcome your emotional pain and be free to fully enjoy your life again.

Examples of painful experiences include:

A broken relationship or divorce.
Death or loss of a loved one.
Death of a pet.
A betrayal.
Being part of an abusive relationship.
A bad injustice.
Loss of a job, position or business.
A grave illness or injury.

The negative emotions from these experiences don't go away on their own, but there is a way to clear them out of your way.
