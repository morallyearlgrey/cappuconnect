Feeling depressed can make life feel heavy, isolating, and overwhelming — but talking about it can help lighten the load.

This supportive meetup focuses on using conversation as a tool to better understand and manage depression. You’ll learn practical ways to express yourself, share experiences, and connect with others who understand what you’re going through.

What you’ll gain:

Techniques for opening up about feelings safely
How to listen and respond in ways that support yourself and others
Tips for turning conversations into opportunities for relief and insight
A safe, non-judgmental space to practice

Join us to explore how meaningful conversations can help you feel less alone, regain perspective, and start moving toward a brighter, more balanced state of mind.
