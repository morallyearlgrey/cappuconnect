Details

This will be a special kind of sketching event: a joint sketching and book signing in conjunction with the Fort Tryon Park Trust. We'll tour different spots in the park and I'll speak to the park's history for a few minutes, just like in my book Unknown New York. And then we'll draw at each spot. You can purchase a book if you like and get it signed, but that's totally optional. If you just come to sketch, that's fine. Fort Tryon is one of my favorite parks to draw in, with its scenic views across the Hudson.

Note the different time - 1:00! We'll meet at the main entrance to the park, which is next to the 190th St. stop on the A train, on the small circle road called Margaret Corbin Plaza. Please don't be late or you might get lost. :)

Any problems on the day of the event, I can be reached at 646-831-9816.
Looking forward to sketching with you!

IMPORTANT: In case of rain, I will let people know early in the morning if it is canceled, and then reschedule for another day.

What makes our Meetups different from other art groups and classes? There's no instruction, but we like to share our work, and chat and be inspired. Share tips and learn from people in a casual environment where all levels of artists are welcome! Don't be shy to ask anyone anything!

• We sketch for a bit, usually 45 minutes or so, and then get back together and share our drawings, and then sketch again, etc. There's usually time for 3 sketches.

• Please bring your own supplies - anything you like to work with - pens, pencil, watercolor, pastel, small sketchbook or large paper, iPad, whatever suits you.

• We hand out nametags so everyone can meet one another!

• We take photos to share on the site later. Take a bunch!

• Sorry, but please leave the dogs at home; they tend to step on the artwork. Thanks.

• The Meetup is FREE and everyone at all skill levels is welcome!
