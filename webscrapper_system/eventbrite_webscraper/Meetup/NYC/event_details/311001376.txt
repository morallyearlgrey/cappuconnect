Demystify the comfort zone—and learn simple ways to move past it.

This is a casual, online meetup—not a formal workshop. As the new co-organizer for Level Up Your Life, I’m excited to meet y’all and get to know each other. We’ll unpack what the comfort zone really is—how it masquerades as “safety” while quietly stalling growth—and the subtle ways it can sabotage your goals and dreams (hello, procrastination, perfectionism, and staying “busy” but stuck). You’ll learn simple, doable ways to start stepping out of it so you can build momentum and change your life for the better. We’ll keep it light, simple, and conversational. You’ll also get to know me—Yelena: Certified Life & Wellness Coach , Clinical hypnotherapist, NLP practitioner.
