Political violence in America has escalated in recent years, with high-profile incidents underscoring deepening polarization. The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the killing of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman (and her husband), and multiple attempts on President Donald Trump highlight how political motivations increasingly drive violent acts.
