Since the pandemic began, we have helped people feel comfortable, confident, helping them open up and connect effortlessly with others.

Open Diner's warm and inclusive environment is available to you every 2 weeks: Meet new friends and FORGET YOUR SOCIAL FEARS.

Anyone feels at home with us, even if you have trouble making friends.

Every 2 weeks, we pick a topic for discussion that we connect around. The atmosphere is always relaxed, friendly and warm.

Everyone is welcome.
