Event expectations: My expectations for this event include people coming together to talk, play games, meet new people, and have fun. What's most important to me is kindness. I ask that we be kind and polite to each other as I want everyone to feel welcome, heard, and appreciated. **Please see my video with expectations here: https://youtu.be/7MMPZNFdqTE**

Guidelines & additional information about this event:
For this event, we are playing codenames for fun and to laugh and socialize with each other. We may not always get all of the rules correct, but we look to laugh it off and have fun. If you are serious about following the rules of codenames, this may not be the right event for you.

How my group plays codenames:

1 word clues
No infinity
No zero or steering
No tagging
Include everyone
Select a Clicker – someone to put in the official group choice and to hit end guessing
You can only talk about the game during your turn – aka when the spy master has laid out your teams clue, not while waiting for spymaster to put out clue
We play with a timer – each team gets 2 mins to guess (unless we decide to change it)
9. We play on teams and no one person should be making all the decisions, everyone should be deciding together.
10. For those who have come from another group to play, my group is different. I ask that everyone play as a group and no one person should be monopolizing or making all the decisions. The group should make decisions as a team. My group is about being kind and friendly and that having fun and having a smile is more important than being rude or hostile just to win. Questions? DM me.
