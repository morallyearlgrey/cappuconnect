EPIC: The Musical is a popular online concept album, created by Jorge Rivera-Herrans, that retells Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey, in a modern, musical style. The story follows the Greek hero Odysseus's ten-year journey home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, facing mythical monsters, gods, and personal challenges.

Key themes explored in the musical include the struggle to maintain one's humanity in the face of difficult choices and the overarching desire to return to loved ones.

This is a fully animated movie of the musical "EPIC" by @JayHerrans . This was only possible because of the incredible cast of EPIC and all the talented animators. The visuals are called "animatics", and are not fully moving animations.

Animatics create a dynamic, moving picture book of the script, helping to establish the visual narrative, rhythm, and pacing of the story.
