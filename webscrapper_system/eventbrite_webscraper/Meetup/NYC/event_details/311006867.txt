Join us on Wednesday, September 24th at Materialize. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. to give attendees plenty of time to grab pizza and socialize, and the talks begin at 7:30 p.m.

Talk 1 — Nicolas Posner - MS Data Science at University of Chicago - Rust/Python Interop

Beyond systems programming and other 'foundational software' use cases where Rust excels, there is increasing interest in embedding Rust into codebases primarily written in other languages: not a full rewrite, but a surgical injection.

One of the main targets for this treatment is Python, one of the most widely used programming languages globally with a long history of interoperation with C and C++. This talk examines the specific use case of Rust in scientific Python codebases, evaluates it against other options on both technical and organizational grounds, and provides hands-on examples of the benefits from augmenting existing Python codebases with Rust.

Talk 2 — Richard Hart - Principal Software Engineer at Antithesis

Writing a Database that folds and bends time in Rust... from Design to Production in 9 months.

Brief overview of Pangolin and what types of queries it supports (5 min)
Overview of Pangolin's MVCC implementation (10 min)
Pros of Rust for this problem-space (5 min)
Cons of Rust for this problem-space (5 min)
Synergies of Rust (formal-methods) and simulation testing (5 min)
Enablement along the way for new developers moving to Rust.

Lawrence Harvey is Rust NYC's official recruitment partner, with Ross providing support as a co-organizer and financial support.
