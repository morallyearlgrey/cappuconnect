This is our monthly talk with a scholar in Modern Stoicism or another branch of philosophy.

This month, we welcome Christopher Gill, who is Emeritus Professor of Ancient Thought at University at Exeter, and he has authored multiple books on ancient philosophy.

StoicDan and Joe Bullock will interview him, and we should have time for Q&A from the audience.

GENERAL

In general, Stoicism teaches us how to handle difficult people and events, how to avoid anger and worry, and overall to use moderation in life. A Stoic practice can lead to a meaningful and fulfilling life.

Our group enjoys open-minded, respectful conversations on Stoicism and how it relates to science, culture, philosophy, history, other belief systems, and pop culture (books and movies). If we differ in our opinions, then "we agree to disagree". The long-term goal is to improve our minds via group discussions. Our group does NOT discuss religion or politics.

This event is free and open to the public.
