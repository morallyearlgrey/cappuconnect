Summary: Trading is 80% mindset. This week, we’ll focus on the psychology behind discipline, patience, and overcoming fear/greed — the difference between consistent winners and everyone else.

Agenda:

0–30 min (Beginners): Common psychological traps new traders fall into (revenge trading, FOMO, overtrading)
30–60 min (Intermediates): Techniques for building discipline, journaling, and sticking to rules under pressure
