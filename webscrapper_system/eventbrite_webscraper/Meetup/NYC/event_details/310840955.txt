So why join a Toastmasters club and how can we help you grow? https://bit.ly/3nsaMky

Every Monday* evening, as Ebony Toastmasters, we get together in a lively and motivating setting to work on our public speaking and leadership goals. Each meeting consists of 3 segments:

Impromptu speeches

Prepared speeches

Constructive Evaluations

Each week, we move toward becoming better speakers by practicing in a safe, encouraging and structured environment nudged forward by people who share the same goal.

Typically we have 25+ attendees. We welcome guests to attend at no charge and see what we are all about. Hope to see you soon!

*PLEASE NOTE that we do NOT meet on statutory or Ontario holidays.
