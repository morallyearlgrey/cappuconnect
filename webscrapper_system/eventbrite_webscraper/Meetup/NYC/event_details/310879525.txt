The purpose of the PMI Pittsburgh Study Group is to provide a forum to connect candidates studying for the PMP exam for group study via self-organized, offline sessions. ​
​
Each month, our session will allow for group introductions, PMP exam target date, and specific study interests in the hopes of identifying group study partners.

Registration for this event will close on September 30, 2025.
