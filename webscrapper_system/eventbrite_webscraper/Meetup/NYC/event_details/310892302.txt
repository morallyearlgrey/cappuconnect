Just like I have been doing for the last 10 years this is a reboot of in person chart analysis and discussion. There will be three trading experts to give their insights as well. We will be showing charts on a big screen and will going through our analysis and thought process of each one. We will also be covering different websites where you can find information. This is an excellent opportunity to come and ask questions. We welcome all levels to join us in analyzing charts in the forex and options Any donations via the meetup site would be incredibly helpful to continue to host these events
