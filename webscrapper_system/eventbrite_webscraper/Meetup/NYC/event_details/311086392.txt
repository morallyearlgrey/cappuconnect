Please note: this is an IN-PERSON meeting in New York City (Brooklyn). Please do not RSVP if you cannot physically attend.

We will be reading chapter 11 of Peter Jones' edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses, "Minerva and Arachne." This is a student edition with a lot of notes on vocabulary, scansion, culture, and grammar, so hopefully it should be accessible to people at different Latin levels.

The idea is to read the stories before the meeting, then go over them again when we're all together to discuss any parts that seemed particularly interesting or difficult.

This selection is very short compared to the others in the book, so if time remains, we can also go over some more of the Pyramus and Thisbe sections from the last meeting that we didn't get to.

We will meet on Saturday, Oct. 18, at 3:00 PM in the main lobby/coffee shop area of the Brooklyn Central Library at Grand Army Plaza. NOTE: I may book a special library meeting room for the event, in which case I will announce it on here (at the time of writing, it is too early to do so).
