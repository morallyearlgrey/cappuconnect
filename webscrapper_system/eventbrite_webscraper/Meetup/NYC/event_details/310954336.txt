Hi folks!

We’re launching a new bi-weekly reading group dedicated to ancient philosophy texts. Our goal is to go more deeply into these works as well as gain insights from mutual discussion and exchange.

Reading for Mon 22 Sep: Plato's Republic Book I

Pre-reading: Plato's Republic is available here: https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.2.i.html

You are encouraged to read ahead. (You’re also welcome to bring your own edition if you prefer.)

Format: On the day, we’ll divide into groups of 2-3 to read and discuss the texts. A guidance sheet with selected passages and discussion prompts will help focus the conversation.

Timing: Groups will meet for 2 x 45mins sessions, then regather to share reflections as a whole.

Social time: Optional hangout afterward for those who want to continue the discussion informally.

Schedule: Every other Monday, 7:00 – 8:30 PM

Location: New Stage Performance Space 36 W 106th St, New York, NY 10025 (subject to changes – please check in day of to confirm)
