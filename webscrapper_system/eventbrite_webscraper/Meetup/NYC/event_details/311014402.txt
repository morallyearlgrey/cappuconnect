👩‍💻 Are you a female founder and tired of building alone?

Instead of navigating the journey solo, we’ll match you in curated groups of 4, based on your vibe, stage & interests and you will meet IRL. 💕

✨ How it works:

RSVP + pay the $10 commitment fee (to keep everyone accountable).
Fill out our short intake form (2 mins) until Sunday the week before the event. https://forms.gle/hyEiaBJbrp3VzLTNA
By Tuesday, same week of the event, you’ll receive your curated group of 4 founders + suggested venues.
Meet your group on Thursday, at 19:00.

Each group is responsible for making their own reservation at suggested venues or picking their own.

💡 Why a fee? To make sure everyone shows up! Think of it as buying accountability + 3 new like-minded founder friends.

We’re so excited to connect you with other inspiring women building their dreams. ✨
